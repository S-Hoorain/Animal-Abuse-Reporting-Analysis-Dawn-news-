The recommendation will be submitted to higher authorities in April as part of a draft bill to tackle animal abuse. In ancient times, dog meat was considered a medicinal tonic. Today, it is commonly available throughout the country, but particularly in the north where dog stew is popular for its supposed warming qualities. In recent years, however, such traditions are increasingly criticised by an affluent, pet-loving, urban middle class. Online petitions against dog and cat consumption have attracted tens of thousands of signatures. Videos showing the maltreatment of farmed dogs have spurred protests at markets where the animals are bought and sold. But the drafters of the new proposal want far more drastic measures, which would oblige law enforcement authorities to close down thousands of dog restaurants and butchers which supply the meat. According to the draft, illegal sale or consumption of pets would incur a maximum penalty of 15 days in prison for individuals or a 500,000 yuan fine for businesses. Public security bureaus would be obliged to respond to hotline calls from the public about violations. “We are proposing that all dog and cat eating should be banned because it is causing many social problems,” said Chang Jiwen, a law professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who heads the drafting team. He said recent murders and thefts related to the dog meat trade showed that it had become a source of tension, while the economic impact of a ban would be small because an increasingly affluent population was less dependent on dog and cat meat. The proposal reflects changing public opinion and international input. Drafters at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences have been consulting for more than a year with Britain's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the US-based International Fund for Animal Welfare. But the plan for a dog meat ban has stirred up fierce debate between animal welfare groups and defenders of traditional values. “I support this proposal. Whether you judge this as a question of food security or emotions, there is absolutely no necessity in China for people to eat dogs and cats,” said Zeng Li, the founder of the Lucky Cats shelter in Beijing. “We need something more than moral pressure. Beijing's dog restaurants get their meat mainly from vagrant and stolen dogs. In the suburbs, dogs are hung and slaughtered in front of buyers.” Online critics said it was hypocritical to protect only dogs and cats, and that the government should focus on human welfare before protecting animals. “This is absurd. Why only dogs and cats? How about pigs, cows and sheep,” wrote a poster going by the name Mummy on the Xhinua news agency website. I hope the experts went to see what laid-off workers and people in rural areas have to eat. They should pay more concern to problems that people really care about,” said another contributor under the name Starfish. Even before the pet meat ban, the draft bill had already provoked controversy. Initial plans for a comprehensive animal welfare law had to be dropped in the face of criticism that human living conditions ought to be the priority at this stage in China's development.",2025-11-15,chinese legal experts are proposing a ban on eating dogs and cats in a contentious move to end a culinary tradition dating back thousands of years the recommendation will be submitted to higher authorities in april as part of a draft bill to tackle animal abuse in ancient times dog meat was considered a medicinal tonic today it is commonly available throughout the country but particularly in the north where dog stew is popular for its supposed warming qualities in recent years however such traditions are increasingly criticised by an affluent pet loving urban middle class online petitions against dog and cat consumption have attracted tens of thousands of signatures videos showing the maltreatment of farmed dogs have spurred protests at markets where the animals are bought and sold but the drafters of the new proposal want far more drastic measures which would oblige law enforcement authorities to close down thousands of dog restaurants and butchers which supply the meat according to the draft illegal sale or consumption of pets would incur a maximum penalty of days in prison for individuals or a yuan fine for businesses public security bureaus would be obliged to respond to hotline calls from the public about violations we are proposing that all dog and cat eating should be banned because it is causing many social problems said chang jiwen a law professor at the chinese academy of social sciences who heads the drafting team he said recent murders and thefts related to the dog meat trade showed that it had become a source of tension while the economic impact of a ban would be small because an increasingly affluent population was less dependent on dog and cat meat the proposal reflects changing public opinion and international input drafters at the chinese academy of social sciences have been consulting for more than a year with britain s royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and the us based international fund for animal welfare but the plan for a dog meat ban has stirred up fierce debate between animal welfare groups and defenders of traditional values i support this proposal whether you judge this as a question of food security or emotions there is absolutely no necessity in china for people to eat dogs and cats said zeng li the founder of the lucky cats shelter in beijing we need something more than moral pressure beijing s dog restaurants get their meat mainly from vagrant and stolen dogs in the suburbs dogs are hung and slaughtered in front of buyers online critics said it was hypocritical to protect only dogs and cats and that the government should focus on human welfare before protecting animals this is absurd why only dogs and cats how about pigs cows and sheep wrote a poster going by the name mummy on the xhinua news agency website i hope the experts went to see what laid off workers and people in rural areas have to eat they should pay more concern to problems that people really care about said another contributor under the name starfish even before the pet meat ban the draft bill had already provoked controversy initial plans for a comprehensive animal welfare law had to be dropped in the face of criticism that human living conditions ought to be the priority at this stage in china s development
2010-07-09T00:00:00Z,Important questions you need to ask yourself before adopting a pet,Important questions you need to ask yourself before adopting a pet - Comment - Images,https://images.dawn.com/news/1183051,"Given how cute and cuddly animals are, it's easy to want to adopt them. However, what is not easy is taking care of them. Caring for pets is a full-time commitment and requires an investment of not just your money but also time and love. We have all heard of pets being cast off because their owners are no longer able to take care of them. Being abandoned leaves pets scared and traumatized. We got in touch with animal activists Ayesha Chundrigar and Sarah J.K to compile a list of things one should consider before getting a pet. Ayesha Chundrigar is the founder and CEO of ACF Animal Rescue and Sarah J.K is the founder of Bella & Buddy and director of Animal Welfare at CDRS; Bella & Buddy sells pet products to generate funds for animals’ rescue. They have advised people to keep the following things in mind before getting a pet: Don't be impulsive, think carefully about whether you lifestyle allows for a pet or not. If your schedule is super busy, a cat might be a suitable pet for you as they are independent and pretty easy to take care of. Rescue/stray cats are even easier because they don't require grooming. Dogs, however, are very dependent on their owners and demand a lot more in terms of proper exercise, love and training. Ayesha said, ""As long as the pet is alive, it has to be like your child, you cannot give it up if and when things get difficult or if they have an ailment. You have to make time for them and be with them in sickness and in health."" The usual life expectancy of happy, healthy animals is 12-15 years so only get them if you can make a lifelong commitment no matter what comes your way. Sarah gave the example of her dog, Honey: ""She was adopted at 3 months and then sent back to me a month later, starving and scared of everything. Then she got adopted again and sent back in one week."" ""She then went to ACF, got depressed, stopped eating."" In the end, Sarah herself adopted Honey who turned our to be an absolute sweetheart. Ayesha also shared an incredibly sad story of a pet adoption drive that was held at T2F. ""At T2F, we had an adoption drive that we're never, ever doing again. All our animals were adopted only because people wanted their photographs posted on social media and wanted to be known as very kind people. From the very next day, all the animals were very slowly and systematically sent back to us. Some were sent back in locked trunks and two dogs even died."" It's heartbreaking to see how cruel people can be. Chundrigar also added that it often happens that once puppies start teething, they start chewing on things and people decide to give them up rather than deal with this issue. Abandoned pets become very anxious, nervous and insecure, and usually end up getting dumped at shelters. Are you willing to invest in proper food, training, grooming as well as medical procedures like spaying, neutering, vaccinations? Owners should realize that having a pet is very expensive therefore, they should only get it if they're in the financial position to give it the best life possible. Sarah said ""When choosing a vet make sure to check the quality of service and the products being used, and keep in mind that good vets and groomers don't come cheap"". Pet owners must make sure to get their pets spayed/neutered once they reach the age which is usually three months, as they are less likely to contract deadly, contagious diseases, such as feline AIDS and feline leukemia, that are spread through bodily fluids. Allowing your pets to breed is unethical and cruel, especially if you cannot take care of their offspring. Make sure you or your family members are NOT allergic to cats or dogs. It's common to see people taking in pets then dumping them a month later because some family member is allergic to them. Sarah suggests that a good way to test this is to board dogs or cats for family and friends. It's best to check out adoption options first, because by purchasing pets you encourage breeders to run unsolicited mills in their homes or farms where animals are kept in terrible conditions and treated like baby making machines. Try to buy or adopt from someone who keeps animals as PETS, with love and care. Ayesha also said: ""Don't be a breed snob. A reason why so many homeless animals are not adopted is because people prefer animals of foreign breeds rather than Pakistani ones"". Based on her own experience, Sarah added that adopting a stray animal with another breed reduces the chance of pets being stolen. Reach out to the pet community and do your research prior to purchasing or adopting. A pet is a life that you have taken responsibility of so make sure you are ready for it. Like Ayesha said, ""Getting a pet just because you find them cute in the moment is not a good reason for adopting an animal, ever"".",2025-11-15,given how cute and cuddly animals are it s easy to want to adopt them however what is not easy is taking care of them caring for pets is a full time commitment and requires an investment of not just your money but also time and love we have all heard of pets being cast off because their owners are no longer able to take care of them being abandoned leaves pets scared and traumatized we got in touch with animal activists ayesha chundrigar and sarah j k to compile a list of things one should consider before getting a pet ayesha chundrigar is the founder and ceo of acf animal rescue and sarah j k is the founder of bella buddy and director of animal welfare at cdrs bella buddy sells pet products to generate funds for animals rescue they have advised people to keep the following things in mind before getting a pet don t be impulsive think carefully about whether you lifestyle allows for a pet or not if your schedule is super busy a cat might be a suitable pet for you as they are independent and pretty easy to take care of rescue stray cats are even easier because they don t require grooming dogs however are very dependent on their owners and demand a lot more in terms of proper exercise love and training ayesha said as long as the pet is alive it has to be like your child you cannot give it up if and when things get difficult or if they have an ailment you have to make time for them and be with them in sickness and in health the usual life expectancy of happy healthy animals is years so only get them if you can make a lifelong commitment no matter what comes your way sarah gave the example of her dog honey she was adopted at months and then sent back to me a month later starving and scared of everything then she got adopted again and sent back in one week she then went to acf got depressed stopped eating in the end sarah herself adopted honey who turned our to be an absolute sweetheart ayesha also shared an incredibly sad story of a pet adoption drive that was held at t f at t f we had an adoption drive that we re never ever doing again all our animals were adopted only because people wanted their photographs posted on social media and wanted to be known as very kind people from the very next day all the animals were very slowly and systematically sent back to us some were sent back in locked trunks and two dogs even died it s heartbreaking to see how cruel people can be chundrigar also added that it often happens that once puppies start teething they start chewing on things and people decide to give them up rather than deal with this issue abandoned pets become very anxious nervous and insecure and usually end up getting dumped at shelters are you willing to invest in proper food training grooming as well as medical procedures like spaying neutering vaccinations owners should realize that having a pet is very expensive therefore they should only get it if they re in the financial position to give it the best life possible sarah said when choosing a vet make sure to check the quality of service and the products being used and keep in mind that good vets and groomers don t come cheap pet owners must make sure to get their pets spayed neutered once they reach the age which is usually three months as they are less likely to contract deadly contagious diseases such as feline aids and feline leukemia that are spread through bodily fluids allowing your pets to breed is unethical and cruel especially if you cannot take care of their offspring make sure you or your family members are not allergic to cats or dogs it s common to see people taking in pets then dumping them a month later because some family member is allergic to them sarah suggests that a good way to test this is to board dogs or cats for family and friends it s best to check out adoption options first because by purchasing pets you encourage breeders to run unsolicited mills in their homes or farms where animals are kept in terrible conditions and treated like baby making machines try to buy or adopt from someone who keeps animals as pets with love and care ayesha also said don t be a breed snob a reason why so many homeless animals are not adopted is because people prefer animals of foreign breeds rather than pakistani ones based on her own experience sarah added that adopting a stray animal with another breed reduces the chance of pets being stolen reach out to the pet community and do your research prior to purchasing or adopting a pet is a life that you have taken responsibility of so make sure you are ready for it like ayesha said getting a pet just because you find them cute in the moment is not a good reason for adopting an animal ever
2010-10-15T00:00:00Z,Animal Cruelty haunts the Balkans,Animal cruelty haunts the Balkans - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/825431/animal-cruelty-haunts-the-balkans,"BELGRADE A video of a Bosnian girl tossing puppies into a fast-flowing river caused international outrage last month; earlier in the year there was the case of a dog found in Serbia with her paws cut off. There are other incidents - from tails hacked off strays to bears being forced to dance - to illustrate startling cruelty towards animals in the Balkans, where having pets was frowned on in the Communist era. The Balkans are “victims of a traditional primitivism”, said Velimir Ivanisevic of the Sarajevo-based Animal Protection group SOS, describing an “inappropriate attitude” towards animals in the region. The footage of the teenage girl casually taking squealing puppies out of a bucket and hurling them one by one into the river was all over the Internet. Authorities tracked her down but it is unclear if she will be charged. The case of the one-year-old dog discovered terrified under a car in a Belgrade suburb in April with her paws sawn off caused similar outrage. The stray, later named Mila, became a cause celebre and local media and businesses rallied to raise money for her care. After months of treatment, she has started to walk on her bandaged stumps. “Such blatant violence shocked even those who have never thought of animals and this is the only positive outcome from this disaster,” said psychologist Nadezda Markovic. Police opened an investigation but, almost six months later, no one has been made accountable. “It is often said, not only in Serbia, that violence against animals is not a big problem as long as there are people who are hungry or mistreated,” said Markovic. “But the difference is that in Serbia, brutal torture and mistreatment of animals is socially acceptable.” Belgrade Mayor Dragan Djilas has taken up Mila's cause, and vowed strict monitoring of her future owner to be chosen by a panel of veterinarians, animal rights activists and city representatives. “We have no way of fighting against sick minds who cut off dogs' paws ... We also need to raise awareness among adults who must take part in preventing monstrous acts such as this one,” Djilas said. Education is one way to confront cruelty to animals but so is cracking down with the full force of the law - something that is not happening, said Ivanisevic, from Bosnia's SOS rights group. “We have to raise younger generations with a right attitude, while with older ones ... we can fight only with fines,” he said. Bosnia adopted an animal protection law in 2009, allowing for fines for torturing animals from 15 to 5,000 euros (19 to 6,400 dollars) or prison terms of up to six months. But since then only one sentence has been delivered, said Ivanisevic, a 1,500-euro fine for a hunting association engaged by local authorities to kill stray dogs in a small town in Bosnia. In Serbia animal rights group Orka has pressured the authorities for years to become more involved in animal care, its campaign leading to strict protection laws in 2006 and the setting up of council-run shelters. Serbian laws may be strict but they mean nothing without the will and manpower to enforce them, said activist Verica Mijic, who is pushing for the establishment of special animal police units within the police. “We launched a petition on Facebook and in only a week, we already had 12,000 people supporting our cause,” she said. It is a similar story across the Balkans. “Most Balkan countries have introduced animal protection laws but they are largely just on paper only,” said Serbian activist Dragana Lucic. Croatia has sentenced one man to jail for animal abuse - he beat his dog to death because it whined and was friendly to passers-by. In Montenegro an animal protection law was introduced in 2008 but no one has been charged under it. It is fairly common to find newborn puppies in bags, or thrown in the river, activists said. Macedonia has had legislation against animal cruelty since 2008, but there are still monthly cases of mass poisoning of strays in the capital Skopje. Albania is yet to adopt an animal protection law and veterinarian Ilir Kusi said that “without it, it is normal to abuse and mistreat the animals”.—AFP",2025-11-15,belgrade a video of a bosnian girl tossing puppies into a fast flowing river caused international outrage last month earlier in the year there was the case of a dog found in serbia with her paws cut off there are other incidents from tails hacked off strays to bears being forced to dance to illustrate startling cruelty towards animals in the balkans where having pets was frowned on in the communist era the balkans are victims of a traditional primitivism said velimir ivanisevic of the sarajevo based animal protection group sos describing an inappropriate attitude towards animals in the region the footage of the teenage girl casually taking squealing puppies out of a bucket and hurling them one by one into the river was all over the internet authorities tracked her down but it is unclear if she will be charged the case of the one year old dog discovered terrified under a car in a belgrade suburb in april with her paws sawn off caused similar outrage the stray later named mila became a cause celebre and local media and businesses rallied to raise money for her care after months of treatment she has started to walk on her bandaged stumps such blatant violence shocked even those who have never thought of animals and this is the only positive outcome from this disaster said psychologist nadezda markovic police opened an investigation but almost six months later no one has been made accountable it is often said not only in serbia that violence against animals is not a big problem as long as there are people who are hungry or mistreated said markovic but the difference is that in serbia brutal torture and mistreatment of animals is socially acceptable belgrade mayor dragan djilas has taken up mila s cause and vowed strict monitoring of her future owner to be chosen by a panel of veterinarians animal rights activists and city representatives we have no way of fighting against sick minds who cut off dogs paws we also need to raise awareness among adults who must take part in preventing monstrous acts such as this one djilas said education is one way to confront cruelty to animals but so is cracking down with the full force of the law something that is not happening said ivanisevic from bosnia s sos rights group we have to raise younger generations with a right attitude while with older ones we can fight only with fines he said bosnia adopted an animal protection law in allowing for fines for torturing animals from to euros to dollars or prison terms of up to six months but since then only one sentence has been delivered said ivanisevic a euro fine for a hunting association engaged by local authorities to kill stray dogs in a small town in bosnia in serbia animal rights group orka has pressured the authorities for years to become more involved in animal care its campaign leading to strict protection laws in and the setting up of council run shelters serbian laws may be strict but they mean nothing without the will and manpower to enforce them said activist verica mijic who is pushing for the establishment of special animal police units within the police we launched a petition on facebook and in only a week we already had people supporting our cause she said it is a similar story across the balkans most balkan countries have introduced animal protection laws but they are largely just on paper only said serbian activist dragana lucic croatia has sentenced one man to jail for animal abuse he beat his dog to death because it whined and was friendly to passers by in montenegro an animal protection law was introduced in but no one has been charged under it it is fairly common to find newborn puppies in bags or thrown in the river activists said macedonia has had legislation against animal cruelty since but there are still monthly cases of mass poisoning of strays in the capital skopje albania is yet to adopt an animal protection law and veterinarian ilir kusi said that without it it is normal to abuse and mistreat the animals afp
2012-01-10T00:00:00Z,Animal welfare - A long way from home,Animal welfare – a long way from home - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/687007/animal-welfare-a-long-way-from-home,"In many ways 2011 was the so-called ‘year of revolution.’ These revolutions spread beyond borders; encompassed social, political and economic crises and brought about change in the world. In Pakistan, social bodies and activists hailed the bills and resolutions that were much called for in a country where the ideology of ‘rights’ remain undecipherable. Taking cue from this wind of change, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) began working on a manual entailing the significance of animal rights, in an attempt to formulate laws to protect the ‘unprotected’, for the first time in several years. The manual includes an elaborate account of policies for protecting domestic and working animals. The debate continues “Why waste time on animal rights when humans don’t get their rights here?” is the usual response to the idea of animal welfare or animal rights in Pakistan. Meanwhile, animal lovers and activists strive to change the mindset that makes both these issues mutually exclusive. “We are trying to create awareness about the fact that we are all interconnected in the web of life, and the need to address different issues simultaneously is of utmost importance,” according to Mahera Omar, co-founder of Pakistan Animal Welfare Society (PAWS). Omar reiterates the negligence towards animal rights. “In a country like Pakistan, the environment and animal welfare are often dismissed as non-issues and countered with the argument that human beings come first.” Bringing about a behavioural change, amongst the people of Pakistan, is vital and PAWS is in the process of designing a ‘humane school kit’ to counsel students about the significance of compassion towards animals. Plight of 'working animals' Pakistan, much like all developing countries, relies on animals for laborious tasks. Equine animals, which include horses, donkeys and mules, face the brunt of animal abuse in most of the cases. Various myths and so-called ‘domestic treatments’ kill hundreds of animals across the country every year – ‘slit nose’ and ‘scorching the skin with metallic rods’ top the list. Dr Sher Nawaz, a veterinary surgeon deployed at Richmond Crawford Veterinary hospital deployed by Brook Hospital for Animals (international animal welfare organisation), informed Dawn.com about the practices being employed eradicate ‘old-school treatments’ which hurt animals more. “Slit nose is a practise which entails slitting the nostrils of animals so that ‘they are able to suck in more air’ for proper breathing. We have mobile health clinics and doctors travelling from place to place so that we can create awareness that this practise is absolutely uncalled for and has no connection with respiratory process.” Brook Pakistan organise community sessions to create awareness against the myths endangering animals’ lives and have set up various mobile health clinics to assist the animals in need. Dr Nawaz is optimistic of the awareness drives. “The post-community session surveys have shown a seven to eight per cent decline in nose slitting throughout the country, which is extremely positive.” “We now plan to visit different schools so that children can be taught about animal rights and advocate the same ideology,” he added. Animals in sports On the contrary to the working animals, animals that are frequently used in races and other equine sports are relatively better looked after by their masters. Donkeys and horses used in cart races are well fed and are taken to the veterinary doctors regularly, as they are required to compete against each other. However, this does not include animals that are raised for fighting, such as dogs and roosters, known for the infamous fights, resulting in deaths and injuries. Rescuing animals Pakistan is not an animal-oriented country which is why rescuing animals and providing them with appropriate shelters add to the woes of animals rights’ activists. “When people tell us about an injured animal, we usually request volunteers or private veterinary doctors in the city to help rescue it. Once the animal has recovered, we try to find a home for it, so that the clinics continue to have space to help more animals in need. If no home is found, then that leaves us with no option but to leave the animal back where we found it,” said Omar of PAWS. Renowned philanthropist and social worker, Abdul Sattar Edhi runs one of the biggest animal shelters in the country, which is located in the outskirts of Karachi. The shelter covers an area of four acres but is unable to provide proper treatment to the injured animals because veterinary doctors find the place ‘too far away for their comfort’. “We run shelters for humans and have never faced any issues regarding governing such an enterprise, however, land mafia has tried to encroach on the land which is meant for animals because people in Pakistan think that this cause is not good enough to be served,” Anwar Kazmi, Edhi’s secretary, told Dawn.com The so-called ‘animal lovers’, who generally belong to the elite section of the society, consider pets a status symbol. The more dogs one has, the richer he/she is. “We get requests from the ‘rich communities’ to take animals away every single day. Some time these animals are only a day or two old so we refuse to take them away because a suckling needs its mother. Anyone who has basic sense would know that a day old kittens and puppies are unable to survive on their own, without their mother,” Kazmi said. “These people do not love animals. They only keep them to show how wealthy they are.” Pedigreed adoptions Many people who appreciate animals are very particular about well-bred, pedigreed animals. However, if everyone will adopt only a pedigreed animal then who will look after all the strays that die or get killed everyday on the streets. PAWS, who give away the rescued animals for adoption, say the most frequently asked question is that about the animal’s breed. “People demand Persians, Siamese, German Shepherds, Boxers, Pitt Bulls and other ‘good breeds’. But what about the all the strays? Don't they deserve our love and affection? Should we not open our hearts and minds to them as well?” said PAWS’ Omar. Stray eradication Various municipal bodies eradicate stray animals by poisoning or shooting them, which is not only expensive but also inhumane. The best way to limit their population growth is to ensure that the streets are clean and garbage heaps are removed daily. Moreover, catching strays and spaying or neutering them is the only ‘humane’ course of action to adopt, in order to stop them from multiplying at a rapid rate. The government should collaborate with various animal welfare societies in order to bring about an end to animal abuse to foster a better and kind society. Animals are meant to be loved regardless of their respective breeds and people who love animals are the only hope to provide the strays with refuge and affection that they particularly deserve.

Unfortunately, present-day Pakistan is governed by people who either do not appreciate the beauty of animals or are indifferent to their plight, which is why places such as pet markets, where animals are kept in heinous conditions for sale, thrive. The beauty of Empress Market, which remains a tourist attraction and a delight for art lovers all across the globe, camouflages all that lies within. Inside the labyrinthine market, there are streets where animals are kept, bought and sold. There is nothing wrong with selling or buying animals, however, the deplorable state in which these animals are kept is abhorrent! An animal lover myself, the zoo and Empress Market remained the two most fascinating places growing up. However, as a child I did not realise the dreadful condition these animals are kept under, in both the aforementioned places. One day, in a bid to revisit the fond memories of my childhood, I visited Empress Market’s animal shops only to find out what I had already dreaded. An “animal concentration camp” is an apt enough description of the condition in which countless cats, dogs, chicks and exotic birds are kept at Empress Market. Amidst the vegetable market are many shops where various animals as young as a few weeks old cry all day long for the sanctuary of their mothers. The cages are packed with kittens, chicks and puppies so much so that there is no room for proper ventilation. Many of the shops have secret chambers where emaciated baby jackals, partridges, owls and other exotic animals are kept without a morsel of food and water. Most of the animals are chained and caged under direct sunlight, panting from the heat. Dogs, deprived of affection and food, yelp constantly for attention. In an effort to look for a shop where the living conditions for animals was slightly better I met a chota or an underling of the shopkeeper, who on condition of anonymity said, “I am sure you can evidently see what all is going on in this market. I do not have to describe anything; however, I must say that the dogs are treated worse than all other animals. Most of the time when a puppy or a dog is severely sick, instead of taking it to a veterinarian, it is left to ‘recuperate’ on its own.” There are incurable diseases in which one has to get animals euthanised but what these shopkeepers do is that they release such animals out in the open, leaving them to die a frightful death,” he added. The truth in his statement was confirmed when I saw a pile of dead puppies lying in a rubbish heap a few meters away from the shop. The decaying remains of dogs, which are considered the most faithful companions, shook me to the core. I thought the sight of rotten dead puppies was the worst that the market had to offer me; however, I was very sadly mistaken. A few yards away I saw a German shepherd, who had defecated in the cage he was kept in, lying lifeless with filth all over and around him. Unable to curtail my anger I looked for the shopkeeper and demanded justification to which he conveniently said “it is being treated; you should have came later in the afternoon and seen how well these animals are looked after.” Hearing this I directed his attention to the aforementioned dog, on which he immediately threw a bucket full of sand. Another shopkeeper, adamant to prove his love for animals, brought out expired packets of animal food and powder used for killing cockroaches and bed bugs for the animals’ fleas and ticks. Disgusted by what I had just witnessed, I ran to the Sindh Wildlife Department to report the animal abuse. Sindh Wildlife Conservator, Saeed Baloch said, “I know that they sell endangered animals and that are very cruel to them. We raid their shops and there are times when we capture partridges, woodpeckers and other birds and release them into their own habitat. However, this network of animal shopkeepers is so strong that the minute our inspection team enters Empress Market, everything ‘illegal’ is either gone or hidden.” I refuse to accept that the deplorable state of affairs can escape anyone’s notice as the cruelty is immensely widespread. The only plausible solution to prevent people from abusing animals is to deploy animal cops at places where animals are kept, bought and sold. The trade of animals should be monitored by representatives of the Wildlife Department and officers should be present to ensure animal welfare during the operational hours of any such market. Another heinous aspect that keeps this cycle of animal abuse running is the fact that most of us believe that in a country where human rights are nonexistent, talking about animal rights is an unpardonable offence. Animal abusers continue with this cruelty because there is not penalty. According to the sources, the Wildlife Department may fine and lodge an FIR against shopkeepers who keep wild animals; however, there is no rule for protecting domestic animals such as dogs, parrots and cats. Shahabuddin Burfat, Karachi Honourary Game Warden, said, “We can take action against people who violate rules and regulations related to wildlife but there is no regulatory body to look after domestic animals. Having said that, I would also like to request people to report cases of animal abuse, to the wildlife authorities, as much as possible. Constant reports might urge the government to establish a committee for the protection of domestic and working animals.” Unless we develop a sense of protecting animals and reprimand people who are cruel towards them, the cycle of abuse will never break. Reporting abuse to the authorities might appear to be a futile exercise; however, it is important to bring animal cruelty into the notice of people who are in a position to offer help. Animal abuse of all kinds, including animals used for fighting, whilst working and captivity must be reported to the authorities, regardless of what the outcome might be. I refuse to believe that our country is dominated by people who are unkind to animals. It is just that the heavy majority, which appreciates and loves animals, is silent and has unfortunately become apathetic. We must realise that if we’re not kind to animals, we’re a very long way from becoming kind to people. The plight of these animals deserves to be heard, so let’s give them a voice.

The protesters also scrawled “Go Nawaz Go” on the boar and tied its limbs with cables before thrashing it to death with sticks. Sadly, this is not the first time an animal has been tortured or killed during a protest, and the practice of bringing helpless creatures out to large public gatherings - a form of torture for many wild animals in itself - continues with next to no criticism.

2014-11-29T00:00:00Z,Searching for strays: Where are Pakistan's animal shelters?,Searching for strays: Where are Pakistan's animal shelters? - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1147713,"Domesticated dogs were already common in 12000 BCE, with some theories suggesting their presence as far back as 16,000 years ago. It is safe to say our companionship is as old as humanity’s recorded history. They shepherd, hunt, guard and pull sleds, all for the price of food, shelter, and a little love. A few months ago, perhaps as a byproduct of having seen too much Cesar Millan on NatGeo, I decided to adopt and raise a puppy. After some research and serious thinking, I came to like the Pit Bull breed. People said they were a handful, but I figured I was too manly to let a little thing like a dog equivalent of a tank deter me. So, I researched some more about the right age, ideal health, structure, etc. and set out to find one. It was a sad realisation that a mere handful of breeders actually knew what they were doing. Some charge criminal amounts and are generally unreliable. But, I’ll skip that part for now. What's more important is that at this point, a good friend of mine pointed me towards the advantage of rescuing a stray puppy off the street. One, they are better acclimated to the environment (leading to better immune systems and more tolerance of extreme weathers). Two, he said, you would be doing a good deed. Also read: People urged to adopt stray animals instead of fancy breeds My friend also pointed out that just because it's a street dog does not make it any less beautiful. Some of them actually look as gorgeous as any pure breeds. I thought to myself, I'm certainly up for it. And stray puppies can’t be hard to find, right? All I’d have to do is stand on the side of a road for four minutes and I’d have one. If I waited a minute more, I’d have choices. Unfortunately, no, it wasn’t that easy. There were numerous reports of stray puppy sightings, but no confirmations that I could make. I once even drove around all of Islamabad just to find a puppy. I found one grownup stray dog, and that was it. The handful I did eventually see were traveling as a family. My wife reminded me that I would be separating a pup from its mother, also known as abduction, so I let them be. A quick Google search told me that though there do exist a few animal rescue services, they are available mostly in major cities and they tend to have more cats than dogs. There is the Bahria Animal Rescue Foundation in Islamabad and the Pakistan Animal Welfare Society operating out of Karachi (amongst others) who are doing what they can, and there are numerous individuals doing their part, but they are even harder to find than the puppies themselves. Also read: Breaking the cycle of animal abuse My search also led me to Lahore’s Tollinton market, where pets were as abundant as there were cheating businessmen. They were trying to pawn off abducted strays as breeds. If you’re not an expert, a clear coloured stray and a Labrador aren’t that different from one another. Shopkeepers make all kinds of promises and guarantees of the dogs’ pure breeds, but I can’t imagine them taking responsibility once the dog grows up and you realise that you’ve been gypped. Moreover, their treatment is cruel: pups sleep in filthy environments, have their cages kicked constantly when a potential customer comes in. It was a place to actively avoid. The thing is that dogs are pack animals. Traditionally accustomed to living in dens owing to their wolf origins. Mothers will hide their pups in places similar to dens where their scent cannot be picked up by potential predators. This means they will be found in sewers, abandoned buildings, isolated areas just at the outskirts of human habitat, etc. Mothers go out and nourish themselves, then come back and feed the pups, until they are strong enough to forage with her. Read on: Animal welfare – a long way from home Sometimes, given the curious nature of puppies, one or two will stray from their dens while the mother is away; they don’t always return. Or, more commonly and quite unfortunately, as it so happens everywhere traffic is found, some mothers don’t make it back to their puppies. These puppies are unlikely to see adulthood. If you are interested in finding yourself a puppy, rescue one of these. Even if you would have to look hard to find them. If it is your first puppy, make sure you take along someone who knows about dogs, so they can tell you if the dogs are indeed abandoned or if their mothers are absent temporarily. You can’t know for sure, but if the puppies appear healthy and well fed, then the mother is probably around. Even though purebreds have temperaments and habits that make them more adept at certain situations, with just a tinge more effort, you can raise any dog about the same. It all comes down to understanding the nature of the animal. Explore: Pets on wheels Some people raise docile Pit Bulls and bulldogs, while others raise aggressive Labradors — it’s all about the kind of effort you want to put in. If you want your dog to be the textbook definition of a dog, you’ll have to put in a few months of effort. The outcome is worth it though. I do wish though that the city’s development authority had an officially sanctioned animal shelter where kids could get their first pets. Instead, we have roaming death squads (much more common in smaller cities). If you have a special affinity towards a pure breed, then by all means, go for it (you probably already know what I’ve just said). However, if all you want is a pet to play with and to keep you safe, you should definitely consider rescuing one off the street.

2015-04-06T00:00:00Z,Slaughterhouse rules: Is halal always humane?,Slaughterhouse rules: Is halal always humane? - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1174300,"Several weeks ago, a video surfaced on the internet, documenting outrageous animal abuse at a ‘halal’ slaughterhouse in North Yorkshire, England. A single viewing of the video is enough to make the most compulsive meat-eater drop the steak knife, and re-examine what ‘halal’ means to us. For those of us who have grown up watching animals bleating and thrashing their legs as they are slaughtered in the front porches of our homes, the video may be only a degree and-a-half above our threshold of tolerance. It depicts workers angrily throwing and kicking sheep across the abattoir floor, sometimes even cheering as they slit the animals’ throats (often in multiple attempts). In the United Kingdom, a country where up to 88 per cent of the animals are 'stunned' before being slaughtered, the uproar was ground-shaking. Also read: Halal food authority? Practicing Muslims around the world, especially in non-Islamic countries, take great pains to ensure that the food they’re consuming is halal. I’ve met conservative Muslim friends in Europe denying themselves ketchup, and altogether avoiding restaurants where non-halal food is served, for fear of it being prepared in the same cookware as pork. Similar care is taken by people of the Jewish faith. Such are the similarities between the religious demands of each group that less discerning Muslims in Western states have a rule of thumb that ‘kosher’ food is permissible for them to eat, as ‘halal’ food is permissible for Jewish people. Regrettably, when we say ‘halal’, we focus solely on the method of slaughter – the correct ritual of zibah by the Muslims, and schechita by the Jews. The preoccupation with the ritual leaves little attention to be paid to the environmental and ethical costs of our demands. Moderate Muslims generally agree that humane production is an integral part of what makes meat ‘halal’. Theoretically, the animal must be killed as swiftly and painlessly as possible, as long as the blood loss isn’t arrested. Read on: Politicising the holy cow, alienating India's minorities In contrast to that ideal, The Telegraph reported a sharp rise in animal slaughter without pre-stunning in the UK, allegedly due to stronger campaigning by Muslims for traditional slaughter practices. Meanwhile, the Danish government put its foot down, and revoked the religious exemption to the law requiring animals to be stunned before slaughter. Fighting the dual charge of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, the minister for food and agriculture, Dan Jørgensen, unapologetically stated that “animal rights come before religion”. Although condemned by the conservatives as an attack on religious values, most progressive Muslims seem to be in agreement with the Danish government. After all, how does it reflect on one’s faith to stand before the court demanding to be exempted from laws preventing animal cruelty, arguing that one’s (interpretation of) religion mandates said cruelty? This is not to say that animal abuse is the fief of halal or kosher meat industry. We have enough footage of animal abuse in regular slaughterhouses to prove an epidemic of apathy for the process that turns a non-human creature into a patty to grace those lonely sesame-buns. Take a look: Seeking a niche in the halal market As I order a bowl of mutton curry at a restaurant, I may have a list of concerns about its price, taste, calorie count, gluten content, genetically-modified ingredients and whether the meat comes from an animal slaughtered in a ritual consistent with my religious values; the suffering of the animal whose remnant lies before me as my casual meal, seldom appears on that list. Clearly, we aren’t being picky enough about what we eat. It may be time for a more comprehensive definition of ‘permissible’ food, which as a matter of decency, should flatly exclude the meat of animals that are not treated humanely.",2025-11-15,several weeks ago a video surfaced on the internet documenting outrageous animal abuse at a halal slaughterhouse in north yorkshire england a single viewing of the video is enough to make the most compulsive meat eater drop the steak knife and re examine what halal means to us for those of us who have grown up watching animals bleating and thrashing their legs as they are slaughtered in the front porches of our homes the video may be only a degree and a half above our threshold of tolerance it depicts workers angrily throwing and kicking sheep across the abattoir floor sometimes even cheering as they slit the animals throats often in multiple attempts in the united kingdom a country where up to per cent of the animals are stunned before being slaughtered the uproar was ground shaking also read halal food authority practicing muslims around the world especially in non islamic countries take great pains to ensure that the food they re consuming is halal i ve met conservative muslim friends in europe denying themselves ketchup and altogether avoiding restaurants where non halal food is served for fear of it being prepared in the same cookware as pork similar care is taken by people of the jewish faith such are the similarities between the religious demands of each group that less discerning muslims in western states have a rule of thumb that kosher food is permissible for them to eat as halal food is permissible for jewish people regrettably when we say halal we focus solely on the method of slaughter the correct ritual of zibah by the muslims and schechita by the jews the preoccupation with the ritual leaves little attention to be paid to the environmental and ethical costs of our demands moderate muslims generally agree that humane production is an integral part of what makes meat halal theoretically the animal must be killed as swiftly and painlessly as possible as long as the blood loss isn t arrested read on politicising the holy cow alienating india s minorities in contrast to that ideal the telegraph reported a sharp rise in animal slaughter without pre stunning in the uk allegedly due to stronger campaigning by muslims for traditional slaughter practices meanwhile the danish government put its foot down and revoked the religious exemption to the law requiring animals to be stunned before slaughter fighting the dual charge of anti semitism and islamophobia the minister for food and agriculture dan j rgensen unapologetically stated that animal rights come before religion although condemned by the conservatives as an attack on religious values most progressive muslims seem to be in agreement with the danish government after all how does it reflect on one s faith to stand before the court demanding to be exempted from laws preventing animal cruelty arguing that one s interpretation of religion mandates said cruelty this is not to say that animal abuse is the fief of halal or kosher meat industry we have enough footage of animal abuse in regular slaughterhouses to prove an epidemic of apathy for the process that turns a non human creature into a patty to grace those lonely sesame buns take a look seeking a niche in the halal market as i order a bowl of mutton curry at a restaurant i may have a list of concerns about its price taste calorie count gluten content genetically modified ingredients and whether the meat comes from an animal slaughtered in a ritual consistent with my religious values the suffering of the animal whose remnant lies before me as my casual meal seldom appears on that list clearly we aren t being picky enough about what we eat it may be time for a more comprehensive definition of permissible food which as a matter of decency should flatly exclude the meat of animals that are not treated humanely
2015-10-03T00:00:00Z,Kaavan to stay at Islamabad Zoo,Kavaan to stay at Islamabad zoo - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1210592,"ISLAMABAD: International expertise will be sought to provide better facilities for the upkeep of animals in Marghazar zoo, particularly Kaavan, the lone elephant, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) decided on Friday. CDA Chairman Maroof Afzal held a meeting which was attended by experts in wildlife and environment including the WWF, Wildlife Department Punjab, the animal society and Lahore Zoo. The experts were asked to give their opinions about what to do for Kavaan. The elephant was recently unchained after criticism from world animal rights campaigners on social media. Online campaigns have called for people to stage protests outside Pakistani embassies worldwide today (Saturday), asking the CDA to send Kaavan to a sanctuary. At the meeting the CDA ruled out sending Kaavan to a sanctuary and decided animals will be provided with more facilities and care. The meeting also agreed on the revival of a committee formed for the improvement, protection and preservation of wildlife and will suggest measures to enhance the biodiversity of Margalla Hills National Park. CDA spokesman Ramzan Sajid said everyone at the meeting thought unchaining the elephant and giving it an open environment had brought good results. However, bringing the animal into an open space demands more care so any potential unpleasant incident may be avoided. He said the CDA chairperson told the meeting the authority would seek expertise from international wildlife organisations for the proper care of the elephant. Member Environment CDA Syed Mustafain Kazmi said Kavaan was healthy and was enjoying life at the zoo. He said the CDA was trying to find a mate for the animal from Sri Lanka or Singapore but “some INGOs are fanning Kavaan’s cause. Instead of focusing on an elephant, they should run campaigns against gross human rights violations in Syria, Iraq, Azad Jammu and Kashmir”. During the meeting, wildlife experts gave suggestions to further improve and preserve wildlife and biodiversity at Margalla Hills and in other areas of Islamabad.

2016-01-26T00:00:00Z,"The pangolian dies - yes, it matters","The pangolin died — yes, it matters - DAWN.COM",https://www.dawn.com/news/1235501,"A member of an endangered species of animals shot five times by a security guard has succumbed to internal injuries, despite earnest efforts by the animal welfare society to save its life. Yes, this is news, and we ought to pay attention. A pangolin is a gentle mammal. It has no teeth. It has small, rounded claws, better suited for climbing than defending. When attacked, a pangolin curls up completely into a ball, tucks its tiny head into it, and hopes for the tough scales on its back to keep it protected during the onslaught. After being shot by a security guard in a posh Karachi neighbourhood, the little ball of bleeding flesh was being harassed by several men with a stick, by the time Dr Ayaz arrived to help him. Pakistan Animals Welfare Society (PAWS) had been alerted of the situation through pictures of the animal posted on social media by a concerned citizen, Ms Nuvera Sheikh. Regrettably, despite medical treatment, the pangolin didn’t make it. At Islamabad’s Marghazar Zoo, human indifference to the suffering of animals is as much on display as the animals themselves. Kaavan, the elephant, has been allegedly been re-chained, and is exhibiting signs of severe stress. Kavaan has been a resident of Marghazar since 1985, his partner – Saheli – died a few years ago. Elephants are extremely social animals, and the solitude is painful enough without the added problem of being underfed, according to the Pakistan Wildlife Foundation, and being kept in an undersized enclosure, sometimes chained. Also read: Unloved and in chains — Kaavan Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has lifted the ban on hunting houbara bustards. The government has determined that letting Arab plutocrats kill endangered birds in Balochistan for sport is a “cornerstone of foreign policy”, and is hence all praise over the lifting of the ban. The pangolin, like the houbara bustard, faces extinction. The Zoological Survery of Pakistan (ZSP) recommended strict conservation efforts to save the pangolin species. Their numbers have been on a steady decline due to poaching, especially because its scales are sought by practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine. It is disturbing to note that there is hardly a trail of exotic animal blood not leading to a traditional Chinese apothecary. Animal rights activists and doctors have long battled on this front, and we aim to continue fighting against these unscientific practices and the cruelty against animals that they require. It may be prudent to keep our fingers crossed, and hope that the pangolin shell trade is not a “cornerstone of foreign policy” with China. In every online comment section, journalists are forced to justify the “excessive” writing space and airtime given to news of animal abuse, while human suffering persists. This unholy triage suggests that the human race is not allowed to mourn the pain of anything other than itself; not unless every human malady, from poverty to crime, has been utterly eradicated. It is only when we’ve achieved a state of Utopian bliss by the next few millennia, should we turn our attention to the four animal species that haven’t gone extinct by then. Also read: A eulogy for 2,100 bustards This revolting speciesism is the product of the same mentality that shames us for condemning racism against the Pakhtun people, because fighting terrorism is ‘more important’; or refusing to condemn terrorism, because focusing on corruption is ‘more important’.

2016-02-25T00:00:00Z,Clifton's war on stray dogs: An excuse for sadism?,Clifton’s war on stray dogs: An excuse for sadism? - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1241633,"Rarely has an ordinary person witnessed the death of a stray dog by gunshot and, at the very least, not wondered if there had been another way. Yes, there is. And the Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC) ought to pay a lot more attention to the alternative. I admit that it may be improper to single out CBC for doing what’s widely practiced throughout the country; that is, the adoption of a ruthless, inefficient, and possibly illegal method for controlling the population of stray animals in suburban districts. It may also be inappropriate of a police officer to flag down just one of many cars that have simultaneously crossed a red light. At best, the driver may curse his misfortune, but not deny his guilt. The Pakistan Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) recently reported the killing of two stray dogs in DHA Phase 2 market, by CBC personnel. The dogs were asleep when they were shot in the neck, posing no immediate threat to the residents. This has happened many times before in Clifton, with residents finding bullet-ridden corpses of dogs lying rotting in the streets or in garbage dumps. At times, the locals find victims of botched execution, who limp about the unforgiving neighbourhood struggling for their lives. Local animal lovers have been rallying against this CBC’s brutality since last year. Allegedly, the culling is ongoing. Also read: Call to enforce law to stop cruelty to animals According to Mustafa Ahmed of a local animal welfare group called ‘Home Four Paw & Claw’ (HFPC), the killing of stray dogs violates an earlier arrangement made by the CBC with his group; where the CBC reportedly agreed to end the culling, as HPFC offered to deal with stray animals humanely. It’s possibly because of this violation, that the CBC spokesperson, Aamir Siddiqui, denies the shooting of stray dogs, even though the Sanitation Supervisor admits that it has occurred. The HFPC is a small organisation of concerned locals that has taken up the task of controlling the stray population in the Clifton area by evacuating, sheltering, vaccinating or neutering them in a humane fashion. One almost hesitates to bring up the matter of animal cruelty, because in a country beset by all forms of unbridled human misery, a plea to alleviate the pain of a street dog comes off as chutzpah. Also read: The pangolin died — yes, it matters The ethical argument to end the shooting of dogs is strong, but a reader unconcerned about ethics may still find plenty of reasons to be incensed by the CBC’s campaign. The HPFC aims to limit the stray population at a fraction of the budget allocated by the Clifton Board for stray dog cleansing, using internationally approved methodologies that do not involve killing. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there is no evidence that culling alone has any real impact on the population of stray dogs, or the control of rabies. Even the highest recorded culling rates of up to 15 per cent, can be easily compensated by the animals’ natural reproductive rate and in-migration. Vaccinating up to 70 per cent of the stray population is generally sufficient to control rabies, and animal birth control programs around the world have repeatedly demonstrated their effectiveness over wanton killing. Last year, as the incidence of rabies caused alarm in Kerala where dog-shooters were set loose on a red-eyed rampage, Jaipur successfully rolled down its own incidence of rabies to a clean zero in a period of eight years. The latter had been achieved by following international guidelines on stray population and rabies control, namely, vaccinating and neutering stray animals. There is, indeed, ample reason for the Indian Supreme Court to prohibit indiscriminate killing of stray dogs. This goes beyond cost and ethics. Mustafa Ahmed laments environmental and safety hazards of the practice of shooting dogs. Dog corpses are often left behind in the streets and improperly designed garbage areas to decompose, and host a new range of communicable diseases. The wide use of 12-bore firearms in residential districts, at times with allegedly unavailable and expired licenses, raises concerns of its own. Take a look: Is KU's mass dog-killing spree the only solution? Organisations like PAWS and HFPC hope to rally ‘animal lovers’ to their cause, but frankly, ‘love’ is just one additional motivator sitting atop a pile of pragmatic reasons to end the culling. Shooting stray dogs is nothing but an impractically expensive exercise in releasing pent-up human frustrations in savage ways — it is sadism seeking an excuse to exist.

2016-03-05T00:00:00Z,Something beautiful is happening at the Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation,Something beautiful is happening at the Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1241406,"Being on a gap year with a university offer and wanting to spend my time working towards improving welfare for animals in Pakistan, I signed up for Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation's (ACF) internship programme. Suffice to say, even before my internship ends there, I am a changed person. Founded in 2014, the ACF's vision is to provide a platform for the marginalised communities within the Pakistani society. Founder Ayesha told me, the foundation started with the ""lowest rung"" of the societal ladder: stray animals. Currently, the ACF focuses its efforts on three main fronts: their animal shelter, their spay/neuter program, and their donkey camps. Also read: Clifton’s war on stray dogs: An excuse for sadism? ""We are a non-profit organisation, not a trust,"" says Ayesha. ""We work on donations and have to do the best we can to make an impact; we still have a long way to go."" ACF’s animal shelter is easily the most recognisable facet of the organisation. Situated on Dalmia Road in Karachi's Gulshan Iqbal area, its red and white hues stand out among the dull, grey-scaled buildings surrounding it. It currently houses around a hundred and seventy animals of all sorts — including two horses, five donkeys, a cow, five eagles and a countless number of dogs and cats. ""The shelter acts as a sanctuary for animals who are mistreated and unable to survive outside these walls,"" says Wajiha Ahmed, co-manager at the shelter. She says that some injured animals live here temporarily. After attending to them, they are spayed/neutered and let out in localities where they know people will be friendly. The rest stay here. Also see: Happy tails for handicapped pets As I walk around the shelter, her words resonate with me. One of the horses there, Iris, is a beautiful young mare — the kind who could easily win animal competitions with a single shake of her glossy mane. Unfortunately, she’s blind, and would not survive alone on the streets with the unwelcome roar of vehicles as her only guide. The other animals are similarly, if not adversely affected. One of the dogs — the three-legged Trio (who intermittently also serves as the watchman at the gate) had a maggot wound on one of his hind legs; it had to be amputated to save the pests from spreading further. Two other dogs, Zeus and Hercules, have paralysed hind legs. Initially pushing themselves on their front legs, they now have a wheelchair each, and are pushed around gleefully by shelter visitors. While the animal shelter is identified as the most significant aspect of ACF’s work, it’s certainly not. The ACF carries out donkey camps throughout the city. Aiming to enhance awareness and reduce abuse of donkeys by their owners, the administration travels to different parts of the city with medicine and other supplies. ""We try to help the owners empathise with these ‘beasts of burden’,"" says Ayesha. ""Most donkey owners abuse the animals and deprive them of their necessary sustenance."" Salman, co-manager at the shelter, explains the process. ""We train them how to treat their donkeys properly, and guide them on the feeding and resting processes. We give them medicine and food items for free at the end. Between 18 to 50 donkeys can be treated in one camp; one camp costs Rs20,000."" Sometimes, the administration is compelled to take weak and dehydrated donkeys back to the shelter with them. During my internship, I have wandered numerous times over to the donkey pen to see them acting like dogs. Quirky and playful, they respond when called out by their names, and bound over to play with anyone who visits them. ""All they need is love,"" explains Wajiha, and laughs, as donkeys Marvin and Juno try to nuzzle us. While the shelter and donkey camps keep everyone busy, ACF doesn't stop there. See: Animal abuse, in the name of protest Interacting with Dr Farid, who is the animal vet at the shelter, I learned that the ACF has a spay-neuter program which has been designed to help reduce the spreading of rabies within the city. Here, they spay each female dog before releasing her back onto the roads. ""We neuter the males as well which means we inject a solution to make them sterile. This ensures effective control of rabies, and also those who attempt to use dogs illegally for breeding purposes won’t be able to take advantage of them."" The foundation has also introduced the ""Sponsor a pet"" program for all those wishing to help. Interested animal-lovers can choose a pet they would like to adopt. They can act as the ""owner"", pay for their pet’s monthly expenses, and even give it a name, while the shelter administration sends them their pet’s monthly progress report, complete with pictures from different angles. My work at the foundation has, in my opinion, been limited. But my growth has been phenomenal. I love animals and have always wanted to work against animal abuse that is so rampant in Pakistan, and at ACF, I found the perfect opportunity to do just that. Initially, my main focus was on helping the administration getting the files sorted, and so on. A week into the internship, I was done an hour early, and stepped out to explore the shelter. Sitting on the bench, I was thrilled to find dogs of all shapes and sizes running up to me. See: Is KU's mass dog-killing spree the only solution? Demanding to be petted, they wouldn't let up. I looked around, observing the shelter inhabitants; most with four legs, some with one or two less. As soon as a visitor would enter, all the animals would run to that person and demand to be petted. I thought to myself: these animals are all strays, hardly pampered pedigrees in air-conditioned houses. They’ve all been abused and tortured by humans, yet they have unwavering faith in us and want nothing but love. I looked ahead and saw Bano aunty, who works as a cleaner at the ACF. Her husband had thrown five bottles of acid on her and had disfigured her face completely, a little over 10 years ago. Refusing to step out of her house in over six years, Ayesha encouraged her to seek therapy in 2013. This empowered her to emerge from her reclusion and begin interacting with those around her. With therapy and surgery, she began working at the foundation, now earning a respectable pay compared to the pittance she would accumulate through odd jobs earlier. I watched as Bano aunty handed out food to the animals; the dogs adored her. Shunned by society, here, she was far from all discrimination. She loved the animals and they reciprocated the love unconditionally. Viewing them, I felt like an outcast for a moment, watching this 'unwanted' members of our community unite in a tender, unwavering bond of their own. ""All they need is love,"" I repeated Wajiha's words, as I went back home that day. And I vowed then to do just that for Pakistan's abused animals. —Photos provided by the ACF",2025-11-15,being on a gap year with a university offer and wanting to spend my time working towards

phenomenal i love animals and have always wanted to work against animal abuse that is so rampant in pakistan and at acf i found the perfect opportunity to do just that initially my main focus was on helping the administration getting the files sorted and so on a week into the internship i was done an hour early and stepped out to explore the shelter sitting on the bench i was thrilled to find dogs of all shapes and sizes running up to me see is ku s mass dog killing spree the only solution demanding to be petted they wouldn t let up i looked around observing the shelter inhabitants most with four legs some with one or two less as soon as a visitor would enter all the animals would run to that person and demand to be petted i thought to myself these animals are all strays hardly pampered pedigrees in air conditioned houses they ve all been abused and tortured by humans yet they have unwavering faith in us and want nothing but love i looked ahead and saw bano aunty who works as a cleaner at the acf her husband had thrown five bottles of acid on her and had disfigured her face completely a little over years ago refusing to step out of her house in over six years ayesha encouraged her to seek therapy in this empowered her to emerge from her reclusion and begin interacting with those around her with therapy and surgery she began working at the foundation now earning a respectable pay compared to the pittance she would accumulate through odd jobs earlier i watched as bano aunty handed out food to the animals the dogs adored her shunned by society here she was far from all discrimination she loved the animals and they reciprocated the love unconditionally viewing them i felt like an outcast for a moment watching this unwanted members of our community unite in a tender unwavering bond of their own all they need is love i repeated wajiha s words as i went back home that day and i vowed then to do just that for pakistan s abused animals photos provided by the

2016-03-27T00:00:00Z,Dead animals,Dead animals - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1248152,"I AM a frequent traveller on G.T. Road from Islamabad to Gujrat. Over a period of time the number of dead animals, on median greenbelt dividing the road, has increased manifold. During my last trip a few weeks ago, I saw about 30 dead animals lying over a distance of 150km. These bodies were from those of cats, wild boars, dogs, goats, donkeys and a cow. While dead animals’ bodies keep lying for weeks and even for months, posing a serious health hazard, it is nauseating to see these dead animals. Recently, I saw an animal’s carcass, probably that of a dog, lying exactly at the same place where it was seen about a month ago. The body had decayed to such an extent that only the skeleton was visible. It was indeed a horrible sight. With the increase in traffic, the number of animals being run over by speedy vehicles has also increased. The worrying part is the apathy of the municipal authorities of these small and big towns on the way. They pay no attention to their quick removal. I have also travelled on the motorway where I rarely came across such a sight. This is perhaps owing to the fence on either side. I am also told that the NHA has a system in place for quick disposal of dead animals on the motorway. A similar system can also be adopted on G.T. Road. All religions lay stress on a respectable way of burying dead animals. Would someone pay attention to this small but very irritating issue? Cdre (r) Sajjad Ali Shah Bokhari Islamabad (2) IN our society animals are tortured severely. The people use the animals all day and do not even provide them sufficient food. This is animal abuse.

2017-01-20T00:00:00Z,Blood and dust at Rahim Yar Khan's 'Camel Dangal',Blood and dust at Rahim Yar Khan's 'Camel Dangal' - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1309610,"Part of Queen Elizabeth’s tour to Pakistan in 1961 was a visit to the horse and cattle show, held at Lahore’s Fortress Stadium. Deemed a bit ""too fierce"" for the Queen’s liking, the event excluded its flagship feature: a camel fight. For Her Majesty, the camels did a little dance instead. Video courtesy - British Pathé Though the Queen has long been gone, a percussive ring of the dhol reverberates at Rahim Yar Khan's camel wrestling competition. This barbaric event draws scores of visitors and serves as a market for millions of rupees to move hands. This year, the dangal (colloquial term for a wrestling event) was held on Jan 18 in Ehsanpur, about 50 kilometres from Rahim Yar Khan. The festival is said to have been organised by a member of Punjab's Provincial Assembly. The lawmaker's alleged involvement in the event is ironic, given that the provincial government has placed a ban on camel fighting. This gruesome dangal featured around 16 fights and attracted thousands of visitors, each of whom paid Rs350 as entry fee. The event was not the first of its kind. Earlier in January, a camel wrestling event in Muzaffargarh became the centre of a police investigation, as part of which, the elder brother of a serving MNA was charged (along with his accomplices) under Pakistan's Gambling Act. Against the heightened political backdrop of this contest, it seems that the camels are merely vessels of political power play between local landlords, wealthy agriculturalists and political bigwigs. Read more: Camel Fight: Dasti's brother booked. At this time of the year, mating season is in full swing and these otherwise gentle beasts are erratic and charged up. Cruelly enough, their energies are harnessed to put up a deeply disturbing spectacle of violence and barbarism. The crowd appears largely unconcerned about the aspect of animal cruelty that characterises the contest. With roughly 4,000 people gathered to watch, the stakes are high and the atmosphere is festive. Read more: Call to enforce law to stop cruelty to animals ""A promotional campaign for the festival had been in place for at least two weeks in the run-up to the event,"" explained Asim, a local journalist who was at the event. A fair amount of planning preceded the festival, raising serious questions about the police's inaction in curbing a banned practice. An owner, whose camel has a reputation for winning, charges his opponent a hefty amount to make his camel available for a fight. When a lesser-known camel beats a mightier camel, its monetary worth increases. For each subsequent fight, the camel owner charges a different amount depending on the camel's track record — and of course, the owner's negotiation skills. As the camels inch closer to each other in what would be a needlessly painful bout, the political context of the event begins to dissolve and a sense of anxiety becomes palpable. The camels have both been pampered and trained all year long for this fateful day. Groomed on a diet of organic eggs, milk and ghee; some of these beasts are going to leave the fight severely injured and possibly dead. Months of conditioning and training comes to a test as the fight begins. Both camels try to dislodge the other by attacking the forelegs. Footage of the event shows their necks in a deadlock with the ‘referee’ spinning helplessly around the two awkwardly positioned camels. They start breathing more intensely as their necks remain locked for over a minute. In a surprise move, one of the camels snaps out of the neck-lock and pins the other camel to the ground, leaving little room for it to retaliate. With all its body weight, it pins the other camel's neck against the dusty ground. It's only a matter of time now, before the victor is declared. The losing camel starts to howl in pain as the live commentators announce a winner on loudspeaker. A section of the jubilant crowd pours into the ring, encircling the camel and taking it for a victory lap around the makeshift arena. Under Article 6(c) of The Prevention of Cruelty of Animals Act 1890, “if any person incites any animal to fight, or aids or abets any such incitement; he shall be punished with a fine which may extend to fifty rupees.” Sporadic and inconsistent interventions by law enforcement agencies, coupled with the heightened political backdrop of the event, makes this traditional affair difficult to extinguish; but what's possibly more worrying is that besides placing an oft-flouted ban, no concrete steps have yet been taken by the government to quell the distasteful tradition of animal fighting in Pakistan. The event lasted about eight hours and attracted thousands of people. ""Some high level police officials were involved in giving the event a green light. In the vicinity of the festival, there were no uniformed policemen,"" alleged Asim, adding, ""neither did the crowd seem too bothered about animal cruelty."" While the gambling that takes place at such events is hard to trace, Pakistan does have anti-gambling laws in place. What needs a revamp are animal cruelty laws. Back in the year 1890, the British enacted a legislation that aimed to prevent cruelty towards animals. For many years, it served its purpose effectively. Back then, Mehekma-e-Berehmi, as it was called, was a government department whose inspectors would patrol the streets and slap on-spot fines to whoever they would find mistreating an animal. The archaic Prevention of Cruelty of Animals Act of 1890, under Article 6(c) maintains that “if any person incites any animal to fight, or aids or abets any such incitement; he shall be punished with a fine which may extend to fifty rupees.” In the early 20th century, Rs50 was a painfully large amount — enough to deter cruelty towards animals. However, after over a century of the currency's devaluation, stipulations for animal cruelty in Pakistani law have been reduced to toothless legal artefacts.

Today, it persists in different parts of South Asia and continues to iconify Pakistan's difficult relationship with some of its traditions. Header: Fighting Camels, Mughal India, c. 1680.

2017-03-16T00:00:00Z,Give the management of Karachi Zoo to experts',‘Give the management of Karachi zoo to experts’ - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1320720,"KARACHI: Increasing concerns over the rights of captive animals have led to major changes at zoos around the world in the last few decades. While this process of transformation is continuing with more scientific data emerging on the complexity of animal life and the negative effects of captivity, there exists a strong opinion against the very concept of zoos. This debate on whether to have or not to have a zoo is very much relevant to Pakistan, a country where animal abuse is rampant, laws on captive animals hardly exist, and living conditions in facilities like the Karachi Zoological Garden are extremely deplorable, to say the least. Faiza Ilyas recently discussed this subject with Rab Nawaz, senior director programmes at the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan. Q: Is there a need for zoos in Pakistan? A: I think zoos play an important role in raising awareness especially in a country like Pakistan where a large majority of the general public does not have access to wilderness areas. For this reason, I think it’s important to improve the conditions of existing zoos by setting up an autonomous expert committee to run [their] affairs without any political interference. However, I will not suggest that more zoos are opened. Q: Is there any zoo in the world that could be a model for us? A: There are many models around the world. However, each zoo has its own particular set of issues and successes so I cannot pinpoint one that can be used as a model. One can say that the Lahore zoo is an example where things have improved. For instance, they worked on how to reduce anger in animals especially large mammals like big cats by using simple techniques such as hiding their food so that they had to spend time and undergo a lot of physical exercise to find it. It’s a very simple thing but has had a big positive impact on the animal’s psychology. They also engaged awareness officers to take children around the zoo in an attempt to raise awareness. This improved the public attitude towards conservation and more importantly captive animals. Lastly, the zoo management was reasonably independent so they could decide on plans, budgets and implementation. Q: Should we have elephants in our zoos since elephant exhibits at a number of zoos in other parts of the world have closed down after research has shown that these mammals have complex psychological needs? A: I agree that zoos should not keep large animals if they don’t have the space. Additionally, elephants are not found in Pakistan so do not play a huge role in raising awareness. Unfortunately, they have been here for a long time so I don’t have an easy answer [regarding] what to do with the existing mammals. One major drawback of having exotic species is that these animals can never be released into the wild and, in many cases, other zoos wouldn’t want them. There is an advantage in having species from other regions but they shouldn’t be brought to zoos at the cost of their health and well being. Places like Lahore and Karachi are hot and humid so many species can’t survive such harsh weather conditions and shouldn’t be kept in their zoos. Most large vertebrates are negatively impacted by being in captivity. Such animals include big cats, primates and polar bears. Q: Would you give some suggestions to the Sindh government on the Karachi zoo revamp plan? A: Give the management of the Karachi zoo to relevant experts. Having it under the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation hasn’t been successful. The Lahore zoo is under the Punjab Wildlife Department and is being run well by their experts. A zoo director should be given a free hand and resources. As I said, simple techniques can bring about major changes in animal behaviour. Conservation or awareness officers at zoos can raise awareness [about] animals. They could even be volunteers. Good signage is also important and is often missing in zoos. Given that most urbanites now have smartphones, zoos can quite cheaply develop an app for people to use at the zoo — especially if they provide free Wi-Fi service. There are also international guidelines on the size of zoo enclosures. This should be a minimum standard. Many zoos are not pressed for space so it would be better to invest in a couple of good quality exhibits rather than trying to maintain a long list of animals.

2017-04-01T00:00:00Z,The weekly weird,The weekly weird - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1324048,"‘Wheelchair’ for goldfish? A Texas goldfish with a disorder preventing it from controlling its own buoyancy is once again swimming upright thanks to a ‘wheelchair.’ Taylor Dean tweeted a photo of the goldfish ‘wheelchair’ her friend Derek, a worker at a San Antonio aquarium, created for a customer whose fish suffered from swim bladder disease, also known as flip over. “Wasn’t able to hold himself upright and was stuck on the bottom. Not anymore! Thought you would get a kick out of it,” Derek wrote in a text message to Dean. The ‘wheelchair’ consists of airline tubing wrapped around the fish along with valves at the bottom that act as the ‘chair.’ The device features Styrofoam at the top and weights at the bottom to keep the goldfish upright. “Just wanted to let you guys know wheelchair fish is still doing well and got an even more comfortable wheelchair,” Dean tweeted. The bizarre ‘Owl cafes’ of Japan Owls fluff up their feathers and preen beneath the stroking fingers of customers at Owl Village, one of the many owl cafés that have popped up around Japan amid the nation’s pet café boom. Here children can play and pet the eight owls, while adults take photos with the birds that are often tied by their feet with a rope so that they don’t fly away. The café, located in the Tokyo’s Harajuku entertainment district is fully booked most days, animal activists show a lot of concerns for the welfare of the birds. Many visitors to the cafés think the cafe need to be more careful in the way they are managing the birds as it is disrupting the natural sleep cycles of owls, which are nocturnal, and tying their feet to perches as many cafés do, can constitute animal abuse. The situation for owls is especially difficult since they are birds of prey used to hunting in expansive habitats at night. Their keen sense of hearing and vision are also poorly adapted to dealing with the brightness and noise of crowded cafes. In addition, they can also develop neurotic and self-destructive behaviour such as pulling at their feathers, pacing, and rocking back and forth, activists say. The owl is a particularly significant animal in Japanese culture as it is commonly considered to be a symbol of good luck. Drone-like ‘hoverbike’ unveiled A team of Russian engineers have unveiled the latest model of their ‘hoverbike,’ an airborne vehicle inspired by quadcopter drone technology. The Hoversurf team posted a video to YouTube showing the Scorpion 3 hoverbike, which bears a stronger resemblance to a giant recreational drone than it does to a bicycle. The team said the hoverbike could have applications in extreme sports as well as transportation. They said there are plans to use the Scorpion platform to build flying cars, taxis and cargo transport vehicles.

2017-05-03T00:00:00Z,How social media and celebrity activists contribute to better animal rights in Pakistan,How social media and celebrity activists contribute to better animal rights in Pakistan - Celebrity - Images,https://images.dawn.com/news/1177374,"Since it sometimes seems like that we're living in a world where even the sanctity of human life seems to have evaporated, it's a little surprising that some Pakistanis are now paying attention to the plight of animals. But they are. Thank God they are. Ask any animal lover in Karachi if they've heard of Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation and you'll hear nothing but good things about all the non-profit does for animal welfare: rescuing abandoned and abused animals, providing them medical aid and shelter and finding them homes too. ACF's Facebook page is filled with uplifting stories about most of their rescues and heartwarming photos that chronicle their rehabilitation. ""Since ACF started operations in 2013, the attitudes of people have changed towards animal rights. They've definitely become better,"" shares Ayesha, the woman behind the shelter. She then says: ""Without social media, ACF wouldn't exist."" ""Social media has been been the most powerful platform for us to spread awareness about our work, maintain transparency that helps wins a donor's trust, constantly create new initiatives and campaigns, encourage people to donate, and finally, it's the easiest way for people to get in touch to report rescues. Many of our 270 plus animals currently and over 1500 rescues over the past three years have been through people reporting via Facebook, Twitter or the ACF phone number,"" says Ayesha. ""There are so many animal lovers in our country and social media is the best way to get connected."" ACF doesn't hold back; the good, the ugly, everything is up for view on their Facebook page. The shelter has experimented with creative ways to spread the word about their work and keep the non-profit running; the foundation recently rolled out some super cute merchandise up for grabs, like t-shirts, mugs and calendars featuring their rescue animals to raise funds. In this way ACF has managed to raise its profile even though its only been in operation for a few years. PAWS, a non-profit that's been working to rehabilitate and rescue stray animals for nearly the past decade has slowly but surely raised awareness among people about why it's essential we treat animals with respect and love. Mahera Omar, the CEO of PAWS, agrees that social media is a vital tool. ""Ever since we formed, and this is back in 2004, we've been trying to get our voices heard. We formed because of these concerns like stray dogs being killed and animal cruelty. These issues have been around for a long time and we wanted to do something about that. But as you know it's a big city so it wasn't easy. Social media has really helped with that. Anyone can create their content and push it out there to educate others,"" she says. Certainly it also helps when people in the limelight such as celebrities turn activists to further the cause. In a way, it's an unfortunate reality; it means that it takes star power for us to care about basic rights and freedoms but that's a debate for another day. ACF has attracted visits and tacit endorsements from high profile celebrities like Anoushey Ashraf and Zoe Viccaji, which only helps its cause as they have extensive fan followings on social media. Chundrigar explains, ""It's really good that celebrities are getting involved and endorsing animal rescue and shedding light on the plight of stray animals. That being said, I would urge more of them to come forward and also to stay consistent. This is a long fight and it can't be just a one-time thing. Even your fans can forget so if we really want to change things, they key is to stay consistent. Yes, it can get exhausting but in my experience, that's the only way things will become different."" ""Because animal rights and animal rescue is in its infancy in Pakistan, it's imperative that celebrities with big fan followings consistently reiterate their support of animal rights in the country."" Recently, an upward spike in culling the stray dog population in Pakistan's urban cities has caused celebrities to sit up and take notice. ""I truly judge a society by the way they treat their animals, which doesn't say much about the society we live in to be honest. I've kept animals since I was a child and I could never, ever see them in pain because I've experienced so much love that they've given in return and it's hard for me to understand when people mistreat or manhandle these voiceless beings,"" divulges Anoushey Ashraf. Ashraf remains hopeful though regarding the future of animal welfare. ""Where we see a lot of violence against animals, we also see a lot of people showing love to them so let's not underestimate our people. I've been to little towns and villages where people love their horses and cows but I think it's in the big cities where we practice a lot of violence, towards other human beings as well as other animals."" ""A lot of people blame me for for standing up for animals rights even before human rights; I think people have been fighting for millions of years, they just don't know when to stop and how to stop but if we stopped taking care of our animals, our plants, nature will retaliate and there will be nothing to fight over if we don't have this planet to live on."" She adds, ""We must respect our animals; they've been here before we were and they'll be here after we're gone so let's not destroy what sustains our lives and mess up our ecosystem's balance."" Not so long ago, actress Muzna Ebrahim uploaded a heart-wrenching video claiming that the authorities had poisoned three of her four rescued canines. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and the Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC) are allegedly killing dogs by feeding them contaminated meat. The television show host organised a protest along with Sarah, an animal rescuer outside Karachi Press Club. ""The dogs of mine that were killed were strays but they were vaccinated, groomed and friendly. These were animals who my daughter had named, who walked her to school, who ate from her hand. And they died in front of us both. They suffered and seized and were convulsing in pain. It was unbearable,"" explains Muzna. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1890 makes cruelty to animals punishable for a first offense with one month imprisonment or Rs50 fine and with three months imprisonment or 100 rupee fine for a subsequent offense. Additionally, section 429 of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 makes it a criminal offense to kill, maim, or render useless any animal, punishable with five years imprisonment, or fine, or both but these laws are largely unimplemented and fairly outdated. The nonchalant stance the authorities seem to have taken to the massacre of these animals is what confuses the public at large as well. ""It's a weird desensitisation happening because these killings are seen as the best solution by the authorities even which is why many people wouldn't speak up,"" says Mahera of PAWS. The KMC seems to have temporarily stopped poisoning stray canines; Ebrahim revealed that the head of the organization, Masood Alam showed up to the protest and promised that they would stop and to her knowledge, he's kept his promise so far. That being said, she says the Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC) and Karachi Cantonment Board (KCB) don't seem to care. However, while talking to Ali Hassan Sajad, Director Media of KMC, we weren't entirely sure what their plan of action is now. ""Of course people had a lot of issues as to how these animals were treated before and that's why many people protested against it. Initially, we used to give this tablet that would give a quick and painless death to the animal, so as to put them out of their misery, but now we've been working on and have found a better way to handle this situation."" ""We are in talks with Indus Hospital and signing an MOU with them. We want to opt for this vaccine now. This vaccine is not like the poison used to kill dogs before. It will calm them down, to the extent that no one will worry about being bitten by them or being chased by them. And when they die, it won't be painful."" But do they die because this vaccine is administered to them? ""Any risk of rabies within the dog is eliminated and they become rather lazy. If their death is caused, it can happen from three months to a year,"" states Mr Hassan. ""We have some NGOs on board and Indus Hospital is collaborating with us. We've had all the initial talks and meetings wrapped up and now we're going to start with getting these vaccines and making this the common way of treating stray dogs. This is about to be implemented soon."" Muzna, on the other hand, dismisses the existence of this magical vaccine. ""There is no such thing. They just call poison medicine."" Still, even some progress is progress at the end of the day. Stray eradication by numerous municipal bodies is inhumane; that much is clear. But what's the alternative? To control population growth, spaying or neutering them is the only humane course of action to adopt, which animal rights groups are encouraging people to do via social media. But ultimately, the government must to step up and collaborate with animal welfare societies in the country if we want to see some actual change. Not to mention, the animal abuse that we witness is not just limited to dogs on the street. It's got to do with donkeys being used for transportation, it's got to do with people who keep pets but mistreat them. While dog culling is a big part of it, it's not all of it and empathy begins at home, on the traffic signal. While we all feel the pain, how many of us are ready to go on the streets, protest and demand real reform?",2025-11-15,since it sometimes seems like that we re living in a world where even the sanctity of human life seems to have evaporated it s a little surprising that some pakistanis are now paying attention to the plight of animals but they are thank god they are ask any animal lover in karachi if they ve heard of ayesha chundrigar foundation and you ll hear nothing but good things about all the non profit does for animal welfare rescuing abandoned and abused animals providing them medical aid and shelter and finding them homes too acf s facebook page is filled with uplifting stories about most of their rescues and heartwarming photos that chronicle their rehabilitation since acf started operations in the attitudes of people have changed towards animal rights they ve definitely become better shares ayesha the woman behind the shelter she then says without social media acf wouldn t exist social media has been been the most powerful platform for us to spread awareness about our work maintain transparency that helps wins a donor s trust constantly create new initiatives and campaigns encourage people to donate and finally it s the easiest way for people to get in touch to report rescues many of our plus animals currently and over rescues over the past three years have been through people reporting via facebook twitter or the acf phone number says ayesha there are so many animal lovers in our country and social media is the best way to get connected acf doesn t hold back the good the ugly everything is up for view on their facebook page the shelter has experimented with creative ways to spread the word about their work and keep the non profit running the foundation recently rolled out some super cute merchandise up for grabs like t shirts mugs and calendars featuring their rescue animals to raise funds in this way acf has managed to raise its profile even though its only been in operation for a few years paws a non profit that s been working to rehabilitate and rescue stray animals for nearly the past decade has slowly but surely raised awareness among people about why it s essential we treat animals with respect and love mahera omar the ceo of paws agrees that social media is a vital tool ever since we formed and this is back in we ve been trying to get our voices heard we formed because of these concerns like stray dogs being killed and animal cruelty these issues have been around for a long time and we wanted to do something about that but as you know it s a big city so it wasn t easy social media has really helped with that anyone can create their content and push it out there to educate others she says certainly it also helps when people in the limelight such as celebrities turn activists to further the cause in a way it s an unfortunate reality it means that it takes star power for us to care about basic rights and freedoms but that s a debate for another day acf has attracted visits and tacit endorsements from high profile celebrities like anoushey ashraf and zoe viccaji which only helps its cause as they have extensive fan followings on social media chundrigar explains it s really good that celebrities are getting involved and endorsing animal rescue and shedding light on the plight of stray animals that being said i would urge more of them to come forward and also to stay consistent this is a long fight and it can t be just a one time thing even your fans can forget so if we really want to change things they key is to stay consistent yes it can get exhausting but in my experience that s the only way things will become different because animal rights and animal rescue is in its infancy in pakistan it s imperative that celebrities with big fan followings consistently reiterate their support of animal rights in the country recently an upward spike in culling the stray dog population in pakistan s urban cities has caused celebrities to sit up and take notice i truly judge a society by the way they treat their animals which doesn t say much about the society we live in to be honest i ve kept animals since i was a child and i could never ever see them in pain because i ve experienced so much love that they ve given in return and it s hard for me to understand when people mistreat or manhandle these voiceless beings divulges anoushey ashraf ashraf remains hopeful though regarding the future of animal welfare where we see a lot of violence against animals we also see a lot of people showing love to them so let s not underestimate our people i ve been to little towns and villages where people love their horses and cows but i think it s in the big cities where we practice a lot of violence towards other human beings as well as other animals a lot of people blame me for for standing up for animals rights even before human rights i think people have been fighting for millions of years they just don t know when to stop and how to stop but if we stopped taking care of our animals our plants nature will retaliate and there will be nothing to fight over if we don t

2017-05-08T00:00:00Z,Saeed had no family until his donkey Raju gave him companionship,Saeed had no family until his donkey Raju gave him companionship - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1331816,"As a thinker in the Marxist tradition, I am interested in labour and fighting for its fair compensation. However, too often, the question of labour within and without the Marxist tradition has focused on male factory or peasant farm labour. Here, I note some of the labour that animals do. If we accept that animals do labour then shouldn’t we find ways to provide them with labour rights? Let's begin with the story of Raju. Raju, a beautiful, meditative donkey, was six months old when Saeed Masih spent everything he had to buy him. Saeed, like Raju, was separated from his parents at a young age. He survived by collecting garbage from bins around Gulberg, Lahore. What he collected he would take to the kabaria to sell. Each day, if he was lucky, brought in a few hundred rupees. He slept on footpaths, under bus stands, and sometimes headed as far out as Data Darbar. After seven years of working in this form, he saved up enough to pay for Raju, around Rs 30,000 at a discounted rate. They hit it off straight away. Saeed had never known a family, he had never known companionship. Neither had Raju. Explore: Animal welfare – a long way from home I went, one windy and rainy afternoon, to visit them. Raju, now ten years old, was resting under a thatched hut made of reeds and supported by bamboo. He had water in a big container and hay straw laid out for him to rest on. Next to Raju’s room was Saeed’s house, also made of stray materials – mud, planks of wood, reeds, and bamboo. It had a TV and two kids excitedly running around. I asked Saeed to tell me more about his life. He's employed by the government as a sweeper, but his main income comes from the work he does with Raju. He told me that he was was able to cover more ground and carry more load once he bought Raju. Once Saeed gets back from his day job, he goes with Raju from mohalla to mohalla to collect garbage from every house. He also gets tips from the houses and recycles the material. With the work Saeed does with Raju, he was able to have enough money to start a family. ""It's all thanks to Raju,"" Saeed says. Saeed teaches his children to be grateful as well. I noted how they pet him and caress Raju with affection. Raju eats before Saeed’s children get to eat – and the kids don’t have a problem with that. The work that Raju does is to transport goods, people, and keep the streets clean. He also provides companionship for Saeed. Lali, a water buffalo, lives in a house with her two daughters in the town of Lalyani, Punjab. She shares the house with her owner Goga, who looks after Lali and milks her. Goga’s family includes his wife Zahra and one daughter. At about five in the morning, Goga wakes up and milks Lali. Then he lets her daughters run over and drink the remainder. He makes sure to leave a sizeable amount of milk in the udder so that the young ones can grow quickly and healthy. Goga is respectful of Lali and understands that Lali’s milk is for her own children and that he is blessed to get some for her daughter as well. After milking, Goga feeds Lali. What she gets depends on the season. At the time I visited, Lali was eating soft leaves of corn. At around six, Goga cleans the area where Lali and her daughters spend nights. The dung is kept aside so that later on it can be baked in the sun and used as fuel. Goga then unties Lali and her family, and heads out into his field. Lali excitedly follows, chewing away at stray barks of grass and wheat from the fields as they head to Goga’s two acres of land about 20 minutes away. Once there, Goga ties the family to polar trees and gives them enough rope so they can each walk around 20 feet in all directions. There is some grass for them to eat and at about 7:30 am, Goga presents Lali and her family with corn leaves that he cuts from his field. Lali loves water and throws herself into Goga’s irrigation canal and bathes herself. At about five in the evening, they all head back. Gogal milks Lali again and lets the baby buffaloes have their share. Goga has a holistic approach to his relation with Lali and feels sorry for the cows that are in neighbouring corporate farms. “wo barhi dyna nai the thea” (they don’t get to see the fields), he sighs. Lali has done a lot for Goga. She has given him two young buffaloes who will also give him milk when they grow up. Lali will also pay for Goga’s daughter's wedding. Goga plans to sell Lali’s children when they are older so that he can raise enough money for the wedding expenses. “ya hi meri inmanat hai,” (this is my treasure) Goga tells me. Gugu Guevara was born on the side of a tent at a building site in the lush grounds of Forman Christian College, Lahore. Soon after her birth, a labourer, unwilling to share his small tent, decided to put her in a plastic bag on the side of the road. A professor, who had had too much coffee and could not sleep, decided to cool off in the morning breeze with a walk. As he strolled, caffeine induced, thoughts whizzed in and out of his mind. What was he going to do about the electricity bill? Would his lover leave him for the smart young guy from Harvard she had been having lunch with? Could he possibly write something as good as Muhammad Hanif? And what of Shah Inayat … was it always fated that revolutionaries would have their heads cut off? As he wandered, he noticed something dark-brownish crawling on the road. “Is it a rat?” he thought. He was scared, but curious. Slowly, he moved towards the object. A young kid was walking by and the professor asked him if it was a rat. The boy laughed and said that it was a cat. Read further: Breaking the cycle of animal abuse Gugu had never opened her eyes, but she knew that the plastic bag wasn’t a safe place and had crawled out. She also sensed a worried thinker around her so she presented herself, but the professor walked back to his house. Confused, he pondered what to do. “The mother will come for her kitten,” he reasoned. But why is she near a plastic bag? She could suffocate. As he was contemplating, it began to rain. On the side of the road, the rain was forming a puddle. The kitten, he worried, would drown. He got a shoe box, put his existential problems aside for a moment, and did what he loved about himself the most: he took action. For to think and not act, he thought, was a waste. But he mostly thought and seldom acted. That was ten years ago. The professor and Gugu Guevara have spend most of those ten years inseparable. He still drinks too much coffee but he has never again been anxious in quite the same way. His thoughts wander, but when existence bears down on him, Gugu comes and rescues him, jumping on his lap and purring to tell him that it’s OK. It took a while, but after about eight years, the professor worked it out too. It is about sensuality, he now knows. One has to sense others, reach out to them, join them in pain and in love, in charity, and in revolution. This is what Gugu taught him. For eight years, Gugu worried about the professor and would have to mind him to make sure he didn’t lapse into depression. It was a lot of work – she would cuddle, reassure, even poke him out of depths of sorrow. Slowly, she noted, he has gotten better and healed a little. The work Gugu does is emotional and intellectual labour. Counsellors and therapists charge by the hour, but Gugu is generous. From production of milk, from transport of goods and people to therapists, animals take on various roles of labour in our world. If we accept that animals perform labour then shouldn’t we look to provide them with labour rights? This would mean a safe work environment, no violence, and medical care and, finally, a safe retirement. I have always fought alongside human labourers in their campaigns for the above and I hope that we can also extend our battle for labour rights also to include Gugu, Raju and Lali and millions of other animals labouring daily.",2025-11-15,as a thinker in the marxist tradition i am interested in labour and fighting for its fair compensation however too often the question of labour within and

2017-12-10T00:00:00Z,media: say no to animal selfies,MEDIA: SAY NO TO ANIMAL SELFIES - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1375558,"Photos of sleepy sloths and curled-up koalas — especially when featured in a selfie — are often considered Instagram gold, guaranteed to attract “likes” and comments. Instagram officials want to change that. On Monday, the popular photo-sharing platform announced that anyone searching for those posts using hashtags will be shown a warning that these seemingly innocent photos are often associated with harmful behaviour toward wildlife. Taking a #koalaselfie or #dolphinkiss photo? Instagram has something to say about it Searching or clicking on hashtags such as #koalaselfie, #elephantride or #dolphinkiss will reveal a pop-up message that reads, “Animal abuse and the sale of endangered animals or their parts is not allowed on Instagram. You are searching for a hashtag that may be associated with posts that encourage harmful behaviour to animals or the environment.” Instagram officials said in a statement that the protection and safety of the natural world is “important to us and our global community.” “We encourage everyone to be thoughtful about interactions with wild animals and the environment to help avoid exploitation,” the company said. The introduction of the warning feature is part of a fine line that social networks walk between stopping the spread of negative images and censoring users. In 2012, Instagram banned accounts, images and hashtags dedicated to “glorifying, promoting or encouraging self-harm,” such as “Thinspiration” photos that depict extremely thin women to encourage users to lose weight. Instagram’s decision to post warnings on certain wildlife hashtags was made after World Animal Protection approached the social network with research showing a 292 percent increase in the number of selfies with wild animals posted since 2014, according to the animal welfare non-profit. More than 40 percent of those photos showed harmful interactions with the animal, such as hugging, holding, riding or inappropriately handling the animal, the group found. These photos often support what World Animal Protection considers cruel behaviour by the wildlife entertainment industry, officials said. Among the most popular photos, for instance, are those depicting a hug from a sloth, said Cassandra Koenen, the group’s head of wildlife campaigns. But sloths, which are arboreal mammals that spend most of their time in trees, are meant to touch down on the ground about once a week. Sloths that appear in these types of photographs are often in captivity, suffering from irregular diets and temperatures with limited space to move around, she said. Their interactions with chemicals such as insect repellent sparks an allergic reaction that causes bald patches on their skin. “When they’re taken from the trees and forced to interact with humans, it’s fearful,” Koenen said. “They’re constantly looking around to get back into the trees while hugging you.” She said she worked with Instagram to compile a list of about 100 hashtags that will trigger the wildlife warnings. The hashtags were chosen based on the most photographed animal species and the types of interactions the animals had with humans in the photos. Instagram has not disclosed most of the hashtags, as officials want users to stumble across them on their own, according to National Geographic. Instagram officials also don’t want people who purposely post illegal wildlife practices to find ways around the warnings. Koenen said she hopes the warnings don’t shame Instagram users but instead educate them about the circumstances that lead to these type of photographs. She said she hopes people will pause and think before posting an animal selfie or liking someone else’s. “It’s about helping people understand: this is what goes into that two-second interaction for you to get that photo,” she said. “Is that really the Instagram experience you want?” “Remember that if you can hug or hold it, or you’re baiting it to have that interaction, it’s always going to be cruel,” she said. In its Wildlife Selfie Code, World Animal Protection encourages tourists to take photos of wild animals without participating in the wildlife entertainment industry and photograph them in their natural environment, where they are free to move around. Instagram isn’t the only social platform to take a stand on wildlife protection. Last year, travel and restaurant review website TripAdvisor announced it would no longer sell tickets to or generate booking revenue from attractions that did not meet animal-welfare standards. After consulting with animal rights groups, the company chose to eliminate activities that involve travellers “coming into physical contact with” captive wild animals or endangered species.

The NGO took the donkey in and shared images on social media of the torture inflicted upon it. According to ACF's post, political supporters tortured the poor animal to prove a point to an opposing party. ""This is a hate crime. A donkey beaten to pulp, punched in the face and abdomen several times, nose broken, kicked all over his body until he collapsed, has rope marks and a car rammed into him....all of this to describe one political party as an “ass” by some hooligans as written on the poor donkey’s body,"" wrote the team. ""We have blurred out the names on the donkey’s body as we will not involve ourselves in this mess. The rest is up to you all to decide."" The donkey was in terrible condition when rescued, but the team immediately got cracking and treated its wounds and injuries. ""The donkey has multiple wounds, all fresh from the beatings, punches and kicks he endured. The wound near his rear was an old abscess which burst probably when he collapsed. His nostrils have been ripped apart and his face was bleeding from all the wounds."" ""There are no signs of internal injury thus far. He is not eating much and his body is still stiff yet shaking in fear. His wounds have been cleaned and he has been given pain killers. He is drinking water on his own."" People have taken to Twitter to express their outrage and grief at the incident. This is not okay. For those of you who see such incidents taking place, please stand up for animals, they are voiceless and helpless. There are dozens of animal rescue teams working tirelessly to protect and save animals in the city, contact them when you witness animals being harmed. This is absolutely NOT okay. Update: The good folks at ACF have named the donkey Hero and have posted an update about him, sharing that ""Hero is very critical right now and under constant observation, IV fluids and treatment. He couldn’t even stand on his own, we had to lift him. He wants to eat but his mouth is full of wounds. He had severe respiratory issues, internal abdominal swelling due to the kicks and punches. He is still trembling. We are trying to help the trauma subside via rehabilitation methods to make him feel safe enough to trust us, hoping that will generate a will to live within him."" Though it has not been confirmed who the perpetrators of this horrendous crime are, many on social media claim this is the work of a few PTI supporters. The party responded to the rumours, without really accepting any responsibility. “Whether it is PTI supporters who beat up a donkey, or Imran Khan opponents who did the same to a dog.... this reveals a vile degeneration in our basic mindset of humanity.

The 45-second video begins with the camera focused on a white dog in the sand, wrapped in a PTI flag. Two men can be heard in the background speaking in a regional dialect, while the video continues to show the dog. The two then briefly appear before the camera, holding a flag belonging to a certain political party. One of the men pulls out a gun and fires a single shot into the dog. He then fires a second shot. And then, a second later, a third. The camera zooms into the dog, it's tail wagging and the video ends with the shooter still speaking. WARNING! This video depicts animal cruelty which viewers may find emotionally distressing. Viewer discretion is advised. A flurry of tweets followed in response to the original post, condemning the brutality and some also identifying the party. On July 16, political workers had tortured a donkey with 'Nawaz' painted over its body. The incident, it would appear, was a twisted reaction to Imran Khan's speech regarding PML-N workers going to receive Nawaz Sharif on his return to Pakistan. The donkey was rescued by an animal welfare organisation, but six days later it reported that the animal had died due to its injuries.

A 45-second clip of two men shooting a dog wrapped in a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Isaf (PTI) flag had emerged on Twitter on Friday night and quickly attracted condemnation from several users. A series of tweets posted by an account claiming to be the official account of the KP police department said that police had acted on the matter after a video of the incident went viral on social media. The suspects were arrested for ""torturing, killing the animal and making [a] video of the shameful crime"". The account also shared pictures of the two men, along with a confessional video of one of the arrested. The account also thanked social media users for ""raising the issue"". One of the arrested men, who identified himself as Umar, confessed that he was involved in the animal abuse incident. After being probed further, he told the police that he was exhorted by a man named Sayeen Ullah to torture the dog. The animal abuse incident was the latest that came to light in the past month. Earlier this month, animal rescue shelter Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation had shared pictures of a donkey who was tortured by political workers, seemingly in reaction to a speech made by PTI Chairman Imran Khan regarding former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's supporters.

2018-07-31T00:00:00Z,Animal Abuse,Animal abuse - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1423791,"THE airwaves, the print media, every chaikhana and drawing room and workshop are overflowing with analysis and speculation about what the July 25 election means for the country. Will the new rulers finally manage to bring about the change so obviously and desperately wanted by millions of citizens? Or will it all prove to be a chimera, in the way that Greek mythology describes it? With such a surfeit of election-related news, many instances of brutal reality have dropped off the radar after having been briefly taken up. One of them pertained to a ‘hero’ who died two days before the new Pakistan appeared on the electoral map. His death was inevitable, but there are few who will mourn or even remember him. So here goes — the print media ought to carry a warning for disturbing and/or graphic content too. Ten days before the elections were scheduled to be held, when the emotions of party activists and their unruliness ran high, the Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation (ACF) for animal welfare received a call about a severely injured donkey that had been found in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal area. The trembling, traumatised soul was taken in by horrified animal rescuers. The beast was found in a condition so distressing that the people at the ACF put the facts up on social media. Hero, as he came to be named, had been severely beaten, punched and kicked in the face and abdomen, and blood was flowing freely. His snout had been broken, his nostrils ripped apart, and his body bore evidence of rope marks and a car having been rammed into him. The trembling, traumatised soul was taken in by the horrified animal rescuers, and he was provided all possible medical treatment. But the injuries were so severe, so unthinkably brutal, that it proved impossible for Hero to survive. Why? “This is a hate crime,” the ACF said on the internet. “We have blurred out the names on the donkey’s body as we will not involve ourselves in this mess. The rest is up to you all to decide.” Indeed. I believe I may not name names here either, but it seems that some supporters of a political party had used the animal to try and set an example for their opponents, after their leader called people supporting the rival party gadhas or asses. This was evident from the names that had been written over the beast’s coat. Of course, a political party cannot really be blamed for the revolting actions taken by those who appeared to be its supporters. But once the crime has occurred, it can certainly come out strongly in defence of the rights of all living things and reject the brutal actions witnessed. Unfortunately, in this case, only a roundabout statement was released on social media amounting to a ‘now, now, don’t be bad’ sort of reprimand for whoever was responsible for poor Hero’s pitiful condition. But this was hardly an aberration. Animal abuse is, unfortunately, rife all over the country; even as a detestable political message or imagery, it has happened before and will happen again. A few days after Hero was found, another tortured animal was given into the care of the ACF. This donkey, too, had been pelted with stones and beaten around the head with jagged objects; his skull was stripped to the bone, and one eye had been gouged out. Around the same time, a video started circulating amongst outraged animal rights defenders showing a dog, wrapped in the flag of a political party and then shot. And let us not forget the white tigress that, in the run-up to the 2013 elections, was paraded across town by another political party desirous of drumming up support at its rallies through the gross display of a powerful creature brought to its knees, signifying no doubt the party’s power. It matters not that this was a beast meant to run in the wild, one of nature’s most sophisticated breathing machines; no, it had to be put in a cage to be jeered at by sophisticated savages, just as Africans were once exhibited in colonial England. It is a sad reflection on the soul of a society when its greatest targets for causing pain and misery are those who cannot fight back, who have no voice. This is a well-known trope regarding human rights, of course, where the abuse of the vulnerable — from children to women to the poor to the undereducated — is par for the course. Some might be tempted to argue that we have to sort out these egregious violations first, before animals can be appended to the long list of beings who need saving. True, but conversely, compassion cannot be selectively hoped for as a characteristic of society. It’s either all, or nothing. And society in new Pakistan, it would appear, has in this regard nothing much in great quantities.

Organised by the Better Pakistan organisation, the protest was joined by animal lovers. Social activist Sarah Gandapur said the event was actually a peace walk to highlight the issue of animal rights in the country. “Our campaign ‘Stop Animal Abuse’ seeks to change society’s perception of animals. Donkeys, dogs and wild boars are the unfortunate targets of often extreme abuse in the country’s rallies and protests.” Talking about an incident of torture of an animal during recent election, Ms Gandapur said it was not the first time that an animal was tortured or killed during a protest, and the practice of bringing helpless creatures out to the large public gatherings – a form of torture for many wild animals in itself – continued with next to no criticism. Through this campaign, she said, they wanted to educate the people and put pressure on the government pay attention to the issue. Better Pakistan Chairman Kashf Shah lamented that the country lacked laws to prevent cruelty to animals. He said the campaign was aimed at creating a relationship between humans and animals.

Over the years, the lists of animals dead or dying, but always overwhelmingly treated in less than a satisfactory manner, has mounted so that the import of animals for the entertainment of the public has itself become questionable. It is not a matter of individuals having their heart in the right place, but of institutional capacity and coordination. Consider, for example, the fact that in the Lahore Zoo, two giraffes died within a month of each other. A trio of the beasts imported from South Africa had arrived on June 25: one of the females died just four days after arrival. Another female imported in early August died on Aug 23. According to the zoo vets, the animal that died in June had developed wounds in her mouths during transportation as well as a gastro infection, while the second giraffe had arrived in a frail condition. The vets say they prepared a report on the second animal and submitted it to the relevant authorities, but zoo officials said that under an agreement with the supplier, no report may be issued about an animal within 30 days of its import. Further, there exists no quarantine facility for imported animals — which ought to deeply concern the Wildlife Department. While these gaps in the system remain unaddressed, the treatment of ‘exhibits’ in the facilities that house tends also to be thoroughly inhumane. Islamabad’s Marghazar Zoo has lost 15 animals over the past couple of years, including an ostrich, lion cubs and nilgai, in addition to a bear just last month. Meanwhile, neglect at the Karachi Zoo also continues to cause similar losses. Running such facilities is about animals’ welfare as opposed to being a public attraction and a city landmark. Until the realisation dawns and the authorities break out of their calcification, it is better that such facilities be shut down.

2018-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Like every other year, 2018 was the year of male rage","Like every other year, 2018 was the year of male rage - Comment - Images",https://images.dawn.com/news/1181344,"It's become increasingly clear that The Hour of Desi Male Rage is far from over; we've lived through a long history of Pakistani men behaving badly with women. Sometimes they want to beat us 'lightly', sometimes they're enraged by women reclaiming public places, sometimes they stab us for rejecting their advances and in some cases, they murder us. As the #MeToo movement landed in Pakistan, displays of male rage online and in real life have spiked. From women being forced off social media because of rape threats to mob violence, toxic masculinity takes many forms and claims many victims - including men. This is not to say that women don't get angry; it's just that it's an emotion that's not encouraged, is considered ""unfeminine"" and is something women often just direct inward. Men, on the other hand, get a hall pass for being frat bros all their lives. It seems that for them, anger is less treacherous and more socially acceptable emotional terrain. This anger stems from a toxic belief that 'masculinity' is synonymous with values such as stoicism, inflexibility, displays of aggression, asserting 'control' or domination over women and resources... and more. Toxic masculinity is just one of the unfortunate symptoms of a deeply patriarchal society. Apart from the direct damage it causes women, toxic masculinity forces men into narrow roles, dehumanising them and desensitising them in the process. While conversations about toxic masculinity are becoming more mainstream - especially in the entertainment industry, with male celebrities like Osman Khalid Butt and Adnan Malik leading the charge - we're still seeing reactions from men that are vastly disproportionate to the issues at hand. Don't believe us? Without further ado, here's this year in ill-mannered men: Male fury is nothing new so we were prepared for backlash against the women's marches that took place across Pakistan on International Women's Day. We already knew that most Pakistanis would react poorly to the idea of women taking to streets to call for equal rights. That said, we WEREN'T prepared for how one little poster about food — one among the hundreds, if not thousands of posters carried at these aurat marches -- would transform a vast number of Pakistani men into emotional wrecks. In case you were wondering, this is the poster we're talking about: Just WHY was this poster so offensive to men? Did they not understand that the poster was a simple call to end gender stereotyping? Apparently not. Clearly, a placard about encouraging men to help out with housework and splitting household chores really makes their blood boil, imagine what they'd do when women start saying it in real life. In this case male rage found an outlet in making illogical statements on social media, like this one: Actually, rights activists in Pakistan also want fundamental human rights. And also, western feminism is not necessarily a benchmark for desi feminists. Read more: Why I made the sign 'Khud khana garam karlo' Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) Captain Maryam Masood and First Officer Shumaila Mazhar are the first women to fly an aircraft via the difficult Islamabad-Gilgit route...but definitely not the first to be subjected to some serious sexism. The duo took the ATR (PK-605) from Islamabad to Gilgit and then flew back (PK-606) safely, a flight the airline shared is ""very challenging and requires a lot of precision and technique"". Obviously, that still wasn't enough for some people to realise that these ladies know what they're doing. Nope, they just had to give their two cents on the matter. Condescending remarks from blaming women for male unemployment (big LOL) to using the good ol' 'ladies can't drive' or 'women belong in the kitchen' stereotypes were used as ammunition; look at these men, always taking misogyny to new heights. A couple of months ago, a video started doing the rounds on social media of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmaker Imran Ali Shah physically attacking a man in Karachi; in the video, we see the MNA who's accompanied by armed guards slapping the man multiple times. Sure, Dr. Shah issued a half-hearted apology after, claiming that he got aggressive because he saw the man ""repeatedly hitting a poor man's car"" and that the man had abused and pushed him first. The PTI lawmaker further claimed that he had only ""pushed"" the man. However, in the video it is clearly visible that Dr Shah smacked the citizen multiple times and his story doesn't check out. 24-year-old Samina Samoon, also known as Samina Sindhu, a local singer from Larkana was shot dead by Tarique Ahmed Jatoi while she was performing at the gathering. Samina was six months pregnant and was shot multiple times because she refused to oblige the intoxicated, belligerent man's request to stand up while she sang. In another case of men not being able to take no for an answer, Sumbul Khan, a theatre artist was fatally shot by three armed men who broke into her house in Sheikh Maltoon Town and demanded that she accompany them to perform at a private event. The men opened fire when Sumbul refused and fled the scene after murdering her. Even petty things, like not having change for Rs1,000 bill could get you a bullet in the forehead. Girls at Dhabas, a collective that has been working towards female visibility in public spheres had their third annual bike rally this year; the rally is an initiative aimed at asserting a woman’s right to navigate public spaces on her terms. In 2016, Aneeqa Ali was harassed and injured while riding her bike out in Lahore and the rally was first started then, to show solidarity with her. That incident triggered much-needed conversations as well as criticism for the way Aneeqa was treated and the sexist actions and comments of her perpetrators. Reclaiming the roads became even more timely. The event encourages women all across the country to challenge the dominant mindset that it is inappropriate for a woman to exercise her freedom of mobility. However, that mindset is one that's deeply ingrained in our society and the comments that followed from men before, during and after are proof of just that. But obviously, it was okay, in fact, lauded when a white woman did it. Cynthia Ritchie ring a bell? Also read: This photo highlights how we apply different standards to desi women versus foreign women Chaos followed after Asia Bibi's acquittal by the Supreme Court last month. Angry mobs of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) protesters burnt cars, shut down cities and raided a young fruit vendor's cart, among other things. A video doing the rounds on social media showed the kid at Sheikhupura’s Batti Chowk being attacked by the forceful crowd who can be seen running away with the goods while he struggles to protect his cart with a stick. This behavior is actually bananas: When Natalia Gul Jilani, a dentist by day and stand-up comedian by night, poked fun at Sindhis (being one herself) it ignited some serious indignation — online and offline. This is why we can't have nice things, people. What followed after were death threats and hate speech, causing Natalia to delete her social media presence. Natalia going off the grid online is yet another example of a woman being forced to go into digital hibernation due to harassment. Speaking of societal suppression, we figured that Natalia was a double-edged sword: it wasn't just that someone was making fun of Sindhis, it was a bigger burn that a woman was doing it. Speaking to Images, Natalia shared: ""Honestly, the rape and death threats were very disturbing and I'm actually leaving town for a while because my family is concerned about security. This is new for me and for them. When you step into the public eye, obviously not everyone is going to like you and I get that but this whole experience is alien for my family as well. I can't explain the suppression I'm feeling from all sides because at the end of the day, I'm a girl. When Ali Gul Pir got some criticism for 'Wadere Ka Beta', I'm sure he wasn't sent gang-rape threats."" The fact of the matter is that the so-called ""line"" in humour is subjective and what's offensive can also be funny. When the line does exist, it's often drawn by men, who cross it anyway whenever they please; who remembers Yasir Hussain dressing up as a Pathan and joking about child abuse or even Ahsan Khan? As we said before: toxic masculinity's rage is not just directed towards women, it's directed towards anyone who doesn't ""stay in their lane"" or the boxes society places them in. Again, we were prepared for some negative reactions when we published a story about aspiring make-up artist Shaheer Khan from Quetta. Better known by his Instagram handle @madeupshaheer, Khan is a self-taught make-up artist wowing his audience on Instagram with daring eye looks and catching the attention of both local and international brands. As for the guy saying men doing makeup is against our religion and if we had the choice to marry Shaheer or Zayn Malik, I mean...think you missed the memo there buddy. In another case of misconduct caught on camera, Gilgit-Baltistan’s tourism minister, Fida Khan resorted to shoving and pushing an airport official due to a flight being delayed and ultimately cancelled as a result of bad weather. Khan, along with Law Minister Advocate Aurangzeb also burnt clothes in protest at the airport lounge and can be seen kicking the extinguisher in the video. We don't know about y'all but we've been stuck at the airport plenty of times due to untimely changes in the flight schedule and managed to power through with lots of coffee and without manhandling anyone. With more and more survivors coming forward with their stories of assault or harassment, men know by now that getting angry is not going to do them any favours. But that doesn't mean it doesn't simmer below the surface and so, the hostility comes out in different ways, like in the form of ""jokes"". Clearly, many Pakistanis still don't seem to understand that violence against women of any kind is not a laughing matter. Haroon Shahid isn't the first (or last) man who thinks it's funny to joke about assault. Yes, the same guy whose debut film (Verna) was about a rape survivor vehemently seeking justice. Shahid quoted a tweet about journalist Gul Bukhari being slapped with a shoe, adding ""A couple from my side as well please. Mein maroon ga to #MeToo hojai ga! (If I hit her, it's become a #MeToo issue)"" After he was called out, he continued joking about, even getting aggressive and only made things worse when he tried to brush off his comment as ""light-hearted"" and nothing more than a ""bad joke"". Eventually tweeted multiple non-apology apologies but by then, the damage was done. Similarly, when Teefa in Trouble released earlier this year, protesters showed up at the premiere in Lahore calling for a boycott of the movie on account of the Ali Zafar-Meesha Shafi sexual harassment case. Waleed Zaman was there to attend the premiere and watch the movie...and run his mouth it seems. A video started circulating on social media from the live stream of the Girls at Dhabas page; while Waleed was walking into the cinema with his wife, the protesters were firing questions at them regarding their views on the matter. Zaman's reply? “Because we support the sexual harassment of women,” he shouted laughingly. This coming from a man whose bread and butter depends on female consumers (he is also the son of fashion label Bareeze's owner). He then proceeded to lie about his actions, saying he was ""angry and upset"" because his wife was being threatened and abused by the peaceful protestors. Who hurt you buddy? (no points for guessing it wasn't the protestors). No, really. The hate and vitriol by men you'll find even just shallow-diving into the comment section of any female celeb is nauseating. Read more: Celebs stand in support of Saba Qamar against online trolls Even if you go through Images' Instagram, you'll find all kinds of abuse directed towards us, any time we post about women's rights. While Meesha accusing Ali Zafar of sexual harassment was received with disbelief by men and women (internalised misogyny at work) both, the men were particularly unbearable. This was the start of Pakistan's #MeToo movement; a mainstream, commercially successful celebrity had just accused another big name in the fraternity of sexual misconduct. It was trail-blazing, brave and a long time coming, judging from the other accounts that followed. That said, this obviously scared men. They knew they might be next, they knew they may have crossed the line in a similar fashion at some point and so their response was laden with anger; it got so bad, Shafi deactivated all her social media accounts for a while. Also read: A timeline of the Meesha Shafi-Ali Zafar controversy Warning: graphic content Back in July, prior to the elections, animal rescue team Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation (ACF) was handed a donkey brutally beaten, wincing in pain and shaken by trauma. The NGO took the donkey in and shared images on social media of the torture inflicted upon it by political supporters who tormented the poor animal to prove a point to an opposing party. ""This is a hate crime. A donkey beaten to pulp, punched in the face and abdomen several times, nose broken, kicked all over his body until he collapsed, has rope marks and a car rammed into him....all of this to describe one political party as an “ass” by some hooligans as written on the poor donkey’s body,"" wrote the team. The donkey, who the shelter had named Hero eventually succumbed to his injuries. And this gruesome act wasn't even a one-pff; in another case of animal abuse involving political workers using defenseless creatures as props, another video was uploaded and shared via Twitter showing a dog wrapped in a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Isaf (PTI) flag being shot mercilessly multiple times.

2019-04-17T00:00:00Z,Lahore's strays find respite from cruelty and abuse at Todd's Welfare Society,Lahore's stray animals find respite from cruelty and abuse at Todd's Welfare Society - Culture - Images,https://images.dawn.com/news/1182413/lahores-stray-animals-find-respite-from-cruelty-and-abuse-at-todds-welfare-society,"Sam is eager to meet new people. His brown eyes glow with warmth and his tail wags when he sees someone he knows. The only thing unusual about him is his hind legs jerking continuously. Brownie, another dog, has a similar issue. Her face twitches. Both dogs have suffered from distemper – a kind of viral disease. They were quarantined, treated and are well now – and looking for a loving home. So are the 60 other dogs – and 15 cats – who are living in the shelter. It is a quiet, tranquil place just off the main Lahore-Kasur Road, a little ahead of village Jhulkay. It has been built specifically to accommodate the animals. For example, besides the main building, which is a couple of rooms meant to be used as an office, and one big back room used for the cat shelter, there are steel cages that line either side of the office building. One side is used for the dogs that need to be quarantined for any reason – like those who are nervous and prefer to be alone for some time. The other side, dogs are much more social. They are taken outside for walks, and playtime. Each cage is divided by a wall of medium height. However it certainly does not stop some of the very overexcited dogs in jumping over into their neighbours apartment – and often even lapping the water in their bowls. Even the cats are taken out of their rooms every day for some fresh air and walks. The Todd’s Welfare Society (TWS) has been running the house for the last two years but on Sunday it was formally inaugurated, with Mr Babar Atta, adviser to the prime minister on polio eradication, starting the event by cutting the ribbon. Later visitors interacted with the animals outside their cages. Credit for the project goes to Kiran Maheen and her volunteers who work day and night at odd hours, juggling their careers and their studies for this work. “I had a dog called Todd who left home one day and never came back,” says Kiran. “I felt very depressed but was shocked at everyone’s attitude around me who told me to get another dog.” She says it dawned on her how people often take animals – even pets to be just commodities, exchanging buying or selling them like accessories. So in memory of Todd, she began a foster care center, which later developed into a full-fledged shelter home and is continuing to expand. “I was very lucky to have the support of my friends – one is an architect who helped me get the building materials for free, while the other designed the place for free,” she says. Their motto is to protect animals. They urge people on Facebook to adopt the homeless or abandoned cats and dogs they find and care for, to volunteer help, to donate to help pay for the treatment of injured and sick animals and if nothing then to foster. ‘Studies show that psychopaths, convicted serial killers and rapists are very likely to have abused animals: remember people who harm animals rarely stop there – stop and report animal abuse’, reads their pamphlet. If it is impossible to believe what extent people can go to, in order to hurt animals, one look at Brutus would explain. Brutus was being used as a fighter dog, and still bears scars on his face and head of those days. He has only three legs now. He was pit against three other dogs who literally bit his leg off. Because he lost that fight, his owner abandoned him, even as he was injured. Abdul Moeed, TWS field manager, remembers his paw was full of maggots and they had to eventually amputate him. There was also a pack of dogs that ate someone’s chickens after which they were trapped, tied up and beaten up so badly that three of them had fractured their legs. There was also Osha who was attacked with an axe, and Tyson who was shot first and then in a panic when he ran onto the road, a car hit him. He was paralysed and afraid of people, but after some time, trusted the volunteers. Tragically though, he died. “When animals are mistreated by their owners we have discovered they do not trust anyone,” says coordinator Zehrish Tahir. “It’s very sad actually.” What is perhaps even sadder is that people are hesitant to take in animals that are not of an expensive breed. Jamie – who looks like a retriever, with his beautiful golden fur coat, is just a stray dog. When his picture was uploaded to call for adoption, Moeed says about 200 calls a day came to ask about him. “As soon as they learnt Jamie was a stray, those who had professed interest never called back.” There is also Flora who can play tricks perfectly, but no one seems to want to give her home either. There are much fewer cats than dogs – and are often easier for the welfare to handle in any case. A furry dark haired Persian called Fudge sits snootily on an upper shelf with just her tail hanging down. Most are well away from visitors sitting on heights, except a couple others who lazily sleep in their tiny ‘cat rooms’ lined with soft cushions. There are rugs, and cat toys, and bowls full of water and dry food – truly cat heaven. “Our objective with healthier animals is to trap, neuter or spay and then release,” says Zehrish. “This way their population is controlled, and they are in less danger from humans attacking them too.” For special cases, there is a temporary shelter on Burki Road or in Cavalry Ground. The volunteers depend a lot on being notified of any animals that need rescuing. All may not be that dark and grim though. Osha, who lost an eye because of the axe attack, Sandy and two other dogs were adopted by families in the UK. “It’s sad but it’s also uplifting to know that these dogs were treated so cruelly in Lahore, but now have been given new lives all the way at the other end of the world,” says Kiran. “Obviously we care a lot for them, but at the end of the day we are constantly in search for a loving home for them.

just off the main lahore kasur road a little ahead of village jhulkay it has been built specifically to accommodate the animals for example besides the main building which is a couple of rooms meant to be used as an office and one big back room used for the cat shelter there are steel cages that line either side of the office building one side is used for the dogs that need to be quarantined for any reason like those who are nervous and prefer to be alone for some time the other side dogs are much more social they are taken outside for walks and playtime each cage is divided by a wall of medium height however it certainly does not stop some of the very overexcited dogs in jumping over into their neighbours apartment and often even lapping the water in their bowls even the cats are taken out of their rooms every day for some fresh air and walks the todd s welfare society tws has been running the house for the last two years but on sunday it was formally inaugurated with mr babar

very depressed but was shocked at everyone s attitude around me who told me to get another dog she says it dawned on her how people often take animals even pets to be just commodities exchanging buying or selling them like accessories so in memory of todd she began a foster care center which later developed into a full fledged shelter home and is continuing to expand i was very lucky to have the support of my friends one is an architect who helped me get the building materials for free while the other designed the place for free she says their motto is to protect animals they urge people on facebook to adopt the homeless or abandoned cats and dogs they find and care for to volunteer help to donate to help pay for the treatment of injured and sick animals and if nothing then to foster

and beaten up so badly that three of them had fractured their legs there was also osha who was attacked with an axe and tyson who was shot first and then in a panic when he ran onto the road a car hit him he was paralysed and afraid of people but after some time trusted the volunteers tragically though he died when animals are mistreated by their owners we have discovered they do not trust anyone

2019-07-02T00:00:00Z,Big Cats of Instagram: Pakistan elite's love of toxic wildlife,Big cats of Instagram: Pakistani elite's love of exotic wildlife - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1491657,"Bilal Mansoor Khawaja beams as he runs his palms over the ivory coat of a white lion, one of thousands of exotic animals at his personal ""zoo"" in Karachi, where a thriving wildlife trade caters to Pakistan's gilded elite. ""These are ... (some) of the rarest animals I own,"" boasts the 29-year-old industrialist of his leashed lion. Pakistani laws make it easy to import exotic animals, but once inside the country regulation is almost non-existent. This has led to an untold number of such creatures — especially big cats, seen as symbols of wealth and power — being imported or bred across Pakistan in recent years, much to the horror of helpless wildlife officials. Social media is littered with videos of wealthy Karachiites cruising with lions sitting in the front seats of luxury SUVs, while newspapers have featured reports of arrests of residents brazenly taking their big cats out for strolls and drives. Khawaja estimates there are up to 300 lions within Karachi's city limits alone, kept in gardens, inside rooftop cages, and at farm houses across the sun-baked metropolis of about 20 million — notorious for its grinding traffic, crumbling infrastructure, and lack of greenspaces. Khawaja calls his handful of lions and a tiger the ""crown jewels"" of a larger collection of more than 4,000 animals he has amassed in recent years. He insists his collection — made up of some 800 different species — is not about status or prestige but simply a manifestation of his love for pets. ""We Pakistanis have a problem: where our heart is soft, it's very soft. Where it's hard, it's very hard,"" he gushes. To care for his flock, he has more than 30 people working in shifts and four vets on staff. The entire operation costs a fortune, Khawaja admits, although he refuses to provide an estimate of just how much he shelled out for his personal zoo. But the cost and the series of minor injuries he has accrued over the years at the hands of his prized pets are well worth it, he claims. ""With every injury my love for these animals ... grows more,"" he smiles. His nine-acre property where a portion of his animals, including zebras, flamingos, and horses, reside is smack in the middle of a dense neighbourhood in the megacity. Exotic animal dealer Aleem Paracha, who claims to be one of the top three importers of exotic animals in Karachi, says that for Rs1.4 million he can deliver a white lion to a client in up to 48 hours — and do so entirely legally. Certificates from the countries of origin along with permits from authorities are provided for any animal brought into Pakistan in accordance with an international treaty to protect endangered species. But Paracha says there is also a network of breeders across Pakistan that can also provide lions at a moment's notice, including at least 30 in Karachi. ""In Karachi, lion farming is going very well,"" he explains. And while indigenous species are fiercely protected in Pakistan, the same protections are not extended to imported animals. The government has guidelines regarding the treatment and type of enclosures big cats and other exotic species should be provided with. But ""the law is silent"" on breeding, explains Javed Mahar, head of Sindh province's wildlife department. Uzma Khan, a technical advisor with the World Wildlife Fund, says there is not even an authority monitoring government-run zoos, which are notorious for neglect, let alone the private sector. ""There's lots of private breeders and they are very shady,"" Khan adds. Meanwhile, owners like Khawaja may have the means and passion to provide the hearty diet for their animals, but others have been known to fall short. Karachi veterinarian Isma Gheewala says lions suffering from calcium deficiencies are common at her clinic, where she says she has treated between 100 to 150 big cats over the years. ""The bones become extremely brittle,"" she explains. ""And even if they jump like a foot down, they will injure some bone or the other and then it takes a long time for the animals to recover."" But both Paracha and Khawaja dismiss claims they are doing anything harmful by taking exotic species out of their natural habit and raising them in Pakistan. ""A lot of animals, either they're extinct or they're on the edge of being extinct,"" argues Khawaja, adding, ""I don't want the next generations to not see these animals."" But conservationists like Khan at the WWF dismiss such arguments. ""An animal in captivity is not the way it is in the wild,"" she explains. ""What's the point of having an animal which is not hunting, which is in a cage not showing its natural behaviour?""",2025-11-15,bilal mansoor khawaja beams as he runs his palms over the ivory coat of a white lion one of thousands of exotic animals at his personal zoo in karachi where a thriving wildlife trade caters to pakistan s gilded elite these are some of the rarest animals i own boasts the year old industrialist of his leashed lion pakistani laws make it easy to import exotic animals but once inside the country regulation is almost non existent this has led to an untold number of such creatures especially big cats seen as symbols of wealth and power being imported or bred across pakistan in recent years much to the horror of helpless wildlife officials social media is littered with videos of wealthy karachiites cruising with lions sitting in the front seats of luxury suvs while newspapers have featured reports of arrests of residents brazenly taking their big cats out for strolls and drives khawaja estimates there are up to lions within karachi s city limits alone kept in gardens inside rooftop cages and at farm houses across the sun baked metropolis of about million notorious for its grinding traffic crumbling infrastructure and lack of greenspaces khawaja calls his handful of lions and a tiger the crown jewels of a larger collection of more than animals he has amassed in recent years he insists his collection made up of some different species is not about status or prestige but simply a manifestation of his love for pets we pakistanis have a problem where our heart is soft it s very soft where it s hard it s very hard he gushes to care for his flock he has more than people working in shifts and four vets on staff the entire operation costs a fortune khawaja admits although he refuses to provide an estimate of just how much he shelled out for his personal zoo but the cost and the series of minor injuries he has accrued over the years at the hands of his prized pets are well worth it he claims with every injury my love for these animals grows more he smiles his nine acre property where a portion of his animals including zebras flamingos and horses reside is smack in the middle of a dense neighbourhood in the megacity exotic animal dealer aleem paracha who claims to be one of the top three importers of exotic animals in karachi says that for rs million he can deliver a white lion to a client in up to hours and do so entirely legally certificates from the countries of origin along with permits from authorities are provided for any animal brought into pakistan in accordance with an international treaty to protect endangered species but paracha says there is also a network of breeders across pakistan that can also provide lions at a moment s notice including at least in karachi in karachi lion farming is going very well he explains and while indigenous species are fiercely protected in pakistan the same protections are not extended to imported animals the government has guidelines regarding the treatment and type of enclosures big cats and other exotic species should be provided with but the law is silent on breeding explains javed mahar head of sindh province s wildlife department uzma khan a technical advisor with the world wildlife fund says there is not even an authority monitoring government run zoos which are notorious for neglect let alone the private sector there s lots of private breeders and they are very shady khan adds meanwhile owners like khawaja may have the means and passion to provide the hearty diet for their animals but others have been known to fall short karachi veterinarian isma gheewala says lions suffering from calcium deficiencies are common at her clinic where she says she has treated between to big cats over the years the bones become extremely brittle she explains and even if they jump like a foot down they will injure some bone or the other and then it takes a long time for the animals to recover but both paracha and khawaja dismiss claims they are doing anything harmful by taking exotic species out of their natural habit and raising them in pakistan a lot of animals either they re extinct or they re on the edge of being extinct argues khawaja adding i don t want the next generations to not see these animals but conservationists like khan at the wwf dismiss such arguments an animal in captivity is not the way it is in the wild she explains what s the point of having an animal which is not hunting which is in a cage not showing its natural behaviour

Thus it is our responsibility to treat them well. From what I see on the streets, at least 70 per cent of cats, dogs, birds and donkeys are suffering from abuse. I recently came across a research which shows links between animal abuse and domestic violence. It suggests that there is a possibility that a child, who is being mistreated at home, might take anger out on another helpless creature such as cats, dogs, horses and livestock. Besides house pets, animals are also used for entertainment purposes in circuses and private zoos. They are trained with sticks and kept hungry. This is not the kind of treatment they deserve. These days, we also have puppy mills where dogs are used purely for breeding purposes. These breeding mills have led to dogs to face severe illnesses such as kidney failure, respiratory issues and heart disease. Apart from breeding, many cosmetic firms also use animals for testing their products before the launch. Around 110 million rabbits, mice, rats, dogs and cats die owing to chemical testing on their skin. These poor rabbits, cats and other animals can be saved if people start reporting animal abuse or just adopting an animal.

We’re very happy that in just 24 to 30 hours they will arrive,” said Malgorzata Chodyla, spokeswoman for the zoo in Poznan, western Poland. Their destination is the Primadomus Wildlife Refuge in the southeastern Spanish town of Villena. Chodyla said there was a brief scare, as two of the tigers did not want to sleep, despite the sedatives they were given. “When the whole team has to enter the enclosure to carry out the tiger and it suddenly lifts its head up, those are some tense moments. But everything happened safely,” she said. She added that the vehicle had heating and the tigers had enough room to switch positions. In late October, Polish border authorities found 10 emaciated and dehydrated big cats in the back of a truck taking them from Italy to a zoo in Russia’s Dagestan Republic. Polish prosecutors charged two Italian truck drivers and a Russian man believed to have organised the journey with animal abuse after the truck got stuck for days on Poland’s border with Belarus. Prosecutors also charged a Polish border service veterinarian for failing to properly examine the tigers when they first arrived at the Koroszczyn crossing, where one of them died. The surviving nine tigers were taken to two Polish zoos. The Poznan zoo described them as “emaciated, dehydrated, with sunken eyes, excrement stuck to their fur, urine burns, in a total state of stress, without the will or desire to live” when they were first discovered. According to animal rights organisations, there are only between 3,200 and 3,900 tigers in the wild worldwide. Another 7,000 are held in captivity, mainly in Asia.

The sport is extremely popular in rural pockets of Tamil Nadu where every year hundreds of young men try to hold the hump of the beasts and run, as spectators cheer raucously at events held across the state. On the opening day of the festival on Thursday, more than 20 men were injured in the city of Madurai as over 600 men wrestled with as many bulls, officials told local media. A female spectator was also injured when a bull hit her near the exit to a venue, the Press Trust of India reported. Images showed men in colourful jerseys trying to grab the bulls who swayed their long horns and gnarled in fury. In past years, competitors have been gored to death. India's Supreme Court had outlawed the sport in 2014 after a plea by animal rights groups. However, the sport was reinstated in 2017 after days of massive protests following which the Tamil Nadu government stepped in and declared bull-taming was a part of the state's culture and identity. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), which has been campaigning for an end to the “abusive” practice, says its past investigations had revealed the bulls were treated with utmost cruelty. “Their tails were bitten, twisted, and yanked to force them to run towards the menacing crowd,” it said in a report last year. “Panicked bulls fled onto village streets, injuring onlookers and even goring some to death.”",2025-11-15,dozens of young men were injured on the first day of a traditional bull taming festival in southern india that activists say is dangerous for both humans and animals the sport is extremely popular in rural pockets of tamil nadu where every year hundreds of young men try to hold the hump of the beasts and run as spectators cheer raucously at events held across the state on the opening day of the festival on thursday more than men were injured in the city of madurai as over men wrestled with as many bulls officials told local media a female spectator was also injured when a bull hit her near the exit to a venue the press trust of india reported images showed men in colourful jerseys trying to grab the bulls who swayed their long horns and gnarled in fury in past years competitors have been gored to death india s supreme court had outlawed the sport in after a plea by animal rights groups however the sport was reinstated in after days of massive protests following which the tamil nadu government stepped in and declared bull taming was a part of the state s culture and identity people for the ethical treatment of animals peta which has been campaigning for an end to the abusive practice says its past investigations had revealed the bulls were treated with utmost cruelty their tails were bitten twisted and yanked to force them to run towards the menacing crowd it said in a report last year panicked bulls fled onto village streets injuring onlookers and even goring some to death

Several animals have died because of such brutal and inhuman acts on the part of shopkeepers or their workers,” Yahya Hussain Shah, a participant in the demonstration told Dawn. “Besides this, the stray animals (especially dogs) are being shot or poisoned inhumanly in the city [Lahore] instead of rehabilitating or adopting them,” he deplored. Carrying placards inscribed with slogans demanding animal rights, closure of the market etc, the protesters urged the government to ban animal trade in the country. They sought immediate government attention towards setting up animal shelters and rehabilitation centres in Lahore and other mega cities. Also seek ban on animal trade On the occasion, Ms Zufishan Anushay, JFK Animal Rescue and Shelter CEO, asked Lahorites to join the campaign against denial of rights to animals at Tollinton and such other markets in the city. “Please join hands for the provision of rights to animals,” she said on the occasion. Meanwhile, a delegation of the Lahore city administration headed by an assistant commissioner also reached the spot and assured the participants of cooperation to end cruelty to animals at the market. “We will take action against those involved in animal abuse, subject to provision of evidence. We will also amend laws so as to provide a safe and secure environment to animal. We are plannig to shift this market to another place,” Mr Yahya quoted AC as having told the demonstrators. The volunteers had last week rescued 50 cats, 12 dogs and a duck being kept in unhygienic conditions at Tollinton Market after buying them from shopkeepers and shifted them to a shelter on Bedian Road for medical treatment.

2020-12-27T00:00:00Z,Society: The dog days of Pakistan,SOCIETY: THE DOG DAYS OF PAKISTAN - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1598024,"Opposite the Republic Monument on Taksim Square is one of Istanbul’s furry tourist attractions — a large Turkish Kungal that has made the last aisle in Watson, a store, its favourite napping spot. As passing tourists take pictures with or of it, depending on their comfort with dogs, a green tag catches their attention — an accessory that seems to be a must-have with canines who call the streets of Istanbul their home. But this store isn’t the only space that welcomes strays. Cats and dogs alike can be seen strolling in and out of cafes, around the Hagia Sofia Square and even the royal palace. The city’s strays — around 160,000 cats and 130,000 dogs — are vaccinated, sterilised, marked and tracked by the government and NGOs. Bowls of food and water on street corners depict the city’s relationship with its four-legged residents: Mutual respect and peaceful co-existence. The tradition of feeding strays dates back to the Ottoman Empire, when butchers were paid monthly wages to feed dogs. Earlier this year, when the city went into lockdown, the interior ministry ordered the local councils to “bring food and water to animal shelters, parks” and upheld the tradition. But, the strays of Istanbul weren’t always this lucky. In 1909, the municipality shipped them to an island in the Marmara Sea, without any food or freshwater. The winds carried their howls through the city. As they starved to death, their desperate pleas were replaced by the rotting stench of their corpses. In the late ’90s and early 2000s, municipalities used the most inhumane, painful, and ineffective method: poison. A quick fix strategy that reduced the dog populations overnight and made governments seem competent and in control. Istanbul’s streets are safe for strays — a change that was sparked by accepting the idea that animals have as much right to be here as us. Can Pakistan follow its lead? Repulsed by the barbarity, activists used social media to stir the public into action, sparking demonstrations that eventually forced the Turkish government to pass a law in 2004: local governments could rehabilitate but were forbidden to kill stray dogs. Public pressure also “forced the government to provide services like regular feeding and medical checks by trained veterinarians.” Didem Tali writes in her piece for The New York Times, “It took 15 years of legislative changes, local initiatives and grassroots activism to make the city more humane.” Meanwhile in Karachi, in 2006, authorities culled thousands of strays using strychnine and by gunning them down. Cash rewards were offered to encourage the public to join in — turning it into a hunting sport of man versus dog. Piles of bodies were bulldozed and dumped. Year after year, the authorities would stir into action and start another barbaric campaign to eliminate dogs who managed to survive and reproduce. Fourteen years later, the situation and strategy remained unchanged. In December 2019, 34,000 strays were culled in Sindh. By October 2020, that count was at 116,000. And yet, as the year comes to an end, the pye-dog population, dog bite cases and rabies continue to be a growing problem in Sindh. Districts such as Larkana and Nawabashah run counterproductive culling campaigns, killing dogs while providing them with garbage dumps — perfect breeding grounds to survive and reproduce quickly. A female gives birth to three to four litters per year. That’s roughly 12 pups for every female who hasn’t been neutered, thus rendering all poisoning efforts useless. Which is why the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Dogs Trust and the RSPCA strongly advocate Animal Birth Control (ABC) through Trap, Neuter and Release (TNR) to be the most effective and humane way. ABC recommends that strays should be captured, vaccinated, neutered, tagged or collared and then released back on the streets. To be effective, at least 70 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated and sterilised. Today, Turkey along with Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India, UAE, Egypt, Brazil, Greece and Kenya are implementing ABC. Sri Lanka and Mexico have successfully eliminated rabies using mass dog vaccination (MDV). Their success boils down to political will, which ensured post-exposure prophylaxis was free and available. Last year, the PC-1 of the Rabies Control Programme was devised by the government with an aim to sterilise and vaccinate 500,000 stray dogs within a year. It failed to launch because of lack of political will and corruption, leading to a petition filed against the government demanding answers. It is now under the new Local Government secretary Najam Ahmed Shah that the situation is beginning to look promising. The court has instructed the Department of Health to release doses, and a revised PC-1 is in the pipes — a more practical plan that has Rabies Free Pakistan (RFP) as its technical adviser and involves the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock to ensure proper implementation. Meanwhile, smaller private initiatives such as the Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation (ACF), RFP and shelters continue to drive the change. RFP, a private sector initiative, was launched in 2018 by Getz Pharma and The Indus Hospital with an aim to reach ‘Zero by 2030’. “Rabies is 100 percent vaccine-preventable, which is why RFP’s mandate includes mass dog vaccination (MDV), animal birth control (ABC) and working towards co-existence.” explains Dr Wajiha Javed who is the Project Director of RFP and the Head of Public Health and Research at Getz. Her teams have vaccinated over 35,000 dogs in Karachi, and sterilised over 10,000 dogs in areas such as Korangi, Landhi, Karachi South, and Saddar. “The females are surgically spayed while the males are chemically castrated. The animals are tagged, either in neon green or red collars and ear-notched before they are released back to their areas,” she says. As part of their efforts, RFP also trains KMC workers and aims at community buy-ins. But for this, they need approvals which are easier to obtain if the local authorities are willing. Ayesha Chundrigar founded the Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation (ACF) in 2013, the first and largest animal rescue and shelter in Pakistan, and has been raising her voice against animal abuse. She has rescued and rehabilitated over 7,000 animals so far and her team rescues between five to 15 abused animals per day. She tries to speak from an animal’s perspective on ACF’s social media platforms and shares their stories. However, the horrific images of abuse, acid attacks, beaten and starved animals with severe injuries and broken spirits really make her wonder about our collective in-depth capacity for empathy. Both teams believe long term success will only come from a change in mindsets. This is why alongside MVD and ABC, they run awareness campaigns on co-existence in schools and districts to educate children, workers and residents. “Our people lack empathy. A dog will not bite unless it is rabid or provoked,” Dr Javed says. “A passerby will tease a dog minding its own business by pelting it with stones, and provoke it for fun.” “We give basic education on understanding animal behaviour: don’t go near a dog protecting its garbage dump, as that’s his food resource, or a mother dog protecting her pups. Our campaign of ‘neighborhood pets’ encourage people to leave out leftovers for the strays in their vicinity,” Ayesha says. But it’s not always people living in close proximity to the dogs that always harm them. “The general complaint that drives authorities into large scale culling is ‘there are lots of dogs and they bark’,” Ayesha explains. These complaints result in commissioners taking action and the next day, tagged strays are found dead. “It all boils down to tolerance, empathy and accepting the idea that animals have as much right to be here as us,” Ayesha emphasises. “I don’t want to run a shelter for abused animals. A shelter overflowing with animals means I have failed in my purpose.” It is the streets that need to be safe, just like they are for the strays of Istanbul.

2021-01-01T00:00:00Z,Istanbul's streets are safe for stray dogs - Can Pakistan follow its lead?,Istanbul’s streets are safe for stray dogs — can Pakistan follow its lead? - Comment - Images,https://images.dawn.com/news/1186313,"Opposite the Republic Monument on Taksim Square is one of Istanbul’s furry tourist attractions — a large Turkish Kungal that has made the last aisle in Watson, a store, its favourite napping spot. As passing tourists take pictures with or of it, depending on their comfort with dogs, a green tag catches their attention — an accessory that seems to be a must-have with canines who call the streets of Istanbul their home. But this store isn’t the only space that welcomes strays. Cats and dogs alike can be seen strolling in and out of cafes, around the Hagia Sofia Square and even the royal palace. The city’s strays — around 160,000 cats and 130,000 dogs — are vaccinated, sterilised, marked and tracked by the government and NGOs. Bowls of food and water on street corners depict the city’s relationship with its four-legged residents: mutual respect and peaceful co-existence. The tradition of feeding strays dates back to the Ottoman Empire, when butchers were paid monthly wages to feed dogs. Earlier this year, when the city went into lockdown, the interior ministry ordered the local councils to “bring food and water to animal shelters, parks” and upheld the tradition. But, the strays of Istanbul weren’t always this lucky. In 1909, the municipality shipped them to an island in the Marmara Sea, without any food or freshwater. The winds carried their howls through the city. As they starved to death, their desperate pleas were replaced by the rotting stench of their corpses. In the late ’90s and early 2000s, municipalities used the most inhumane, painful, and ineffective method: poison. A quick fix strategy that reduced the dog populations overnight and made governments seem competent and in control. Istanbul’s streets are safe for strays — a change that was sparked by accepting the idea that animals have as much right to be here as us. Can Pakistan follow its lead? Repulsed by the barbarity, activists used social media to stir the public into action, sparking demonstrations that eventually forced the Turkish government to pass a law in 2004: local governments could rehabilitate but were forbidden to kill stray dogs. Public pressure also “forced the government to provide services like regular feeding and medical checks by trained veterinarians.” Didem Tali writes in her piece for The New York Times, “It took 15 years of legislative changes, local initiatives and grassroots activism to make the city more humane.” Meanwhile in Karachi, in 2006, authorities culled thousands of strays using strychnine and by gunning them down. Cash rewards were offered to encourage the public to join in — turning it into a hunting sport of man versus dog. Piles of bodies were bulldozed and dumped. Year after year, the authorities would stir into action and start another barbaric campaign to eliminate dogs who managed to survive and reproduce. Fourteen years later, the situation and strategy remained unchanged. In December 2019, 34,000 strays were culled in Sindh. By October 2020, that count was at 116,000. And yet, as the year comes to an end, the pye-dog population, dog bite cases and rabies continue to be a growing problem in Sindh. Districts such as Larkana and Nawabashah run counterproductive culling campaigns, killing dogs while providing them with garbage dumps — perfect breeding grounds to survive and reproduce quickly. A female gives birth to three to four litters per year. That’s roughly 12 pups for every female who hasn’t been neutered, thus rendering all poisoning efforts useless. Which is why the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Dogs Trust and the RSPCA strongly advocate Animal Birth Control (ABC) through Trap, Neuter and Release (TNR) to be the most effective and humane way. ABC recommends that strays should be captured, vaccinated, neutered, tagged or collared and then released back on the streets. To be effective, at least 70 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated and sterilised. Today, Turkey along with Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India, UAE, Egypt, Brazil, Greece and Kenya are implementing ABC. Sri Lanka and Mexico have successfully eliminated rabies using mass dog vaccination (MDV). Their success boils down to political will, which ensured post-exposure prophylaxis was free and available. Last year, the PC-1 of the Rabies Control Programme was devised by the government with an aim to sterilise and vaccinate 500,000 stray dogs within a year. It failed to launch because of lack of political will and corruption, leading to a petition filed against the government demanding answers. It is now under the new Local Government secretary Najam Ahmed Shah that the situation is beginning to look promising. The court has instructed the Department of Health to release doses, and a revised PC-1 is in the pipes — a more practical plan that has Rabies Free Pakistan (RFP) as its technical adviser and involves the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock to ensure proper implementation. Meanwhile, smaller private initiatives such as the Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation (ACF), RFP and shelters continue to drive the change. RFP, a private sector initiative, was launched in 2018 by Getz Pharma and The Indus Hospital with an aim to reach ‘Zero by 2030’. “Rabies is 100 percent vaccine-preventable, which is why RFP’s mandate includes mass dog vaccination (MDV), animal birth control (ABC) and working towards co-existence.” explains Dr Wajiha Javed who is the Project Director of RFP and the Head of Public Health and Research at Getz. Her teams have vaccinated over 35,000 dogs in Karachi, and sterilised over 10,000 dogs in areas such as Korangi, Landhi, Karachi South, and Saddar. “The females are surgically spayed while the males are chemically castrated. The animals are tagged, either in neon green or red collars and ear-notched before they are released back to their areas,” she says. As part of their efforts, RFP also trains KMC workers and aims at community buy-ins. But for this, they need approvals which are easier to obtain if the local authorities are willing. Ayesha Chundrigar founded the Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation (ACF) in 2013, the first and largest animal rescue and shelter in Pakistan, and has been raising her voice against animal abuse. She has rescued and rehabilitated over 7,000 animals so far and her team rescues between five to 15 abused animals per day. She tries to speak from an animal’s perspective on ACF’s social media platforms and shares their stories. However, the horrific images of abuse, acid attacks, beaten and starved animals with severe injuries and broken spirits really make her wonder about our collective in-depth capacity for empathy. Both teams believe long term success will only come from a change in mindsets. This is why alongside MVD and ABC, they run awareness campaigns on co-existence in schools and districts to educate children, workers and residents. “Our people lack empathy. A dog will not bite unless it is rabid or provoked,” Dr Javed says. “A passerby will tease a dog minding its own business by pelting it with stones, and provoke it for fun.” “We give basic education on understanding animal behaviour: don’t go near a dog protecting its garbage dump, as that’s his food resource, or a mother dog protecting her pups.

2021-01-24T00:00:00Z,The rising trend of Pets - but what about mistreatment?,A rising trend of pets – but what about mistreatment? - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1603231/a-rising-trend-of-pets-but-what-about-mistreatment,"LAHORE: When animal welfare activist Iffrah Mubasher rescued Tipu, the kitten was in a shockingly bad state. “His fur was matted, and shed off in patches to the pink skin underneath,” she says. “He was severely malnourished and dehydrated. I thought he might not last for long.” The kitten had suffered grave neglect by its owners, a family from Gujranwala, and an animal-loving acquaintance had finally taken it from them and handed to the rescue shelter Iffrah volunteers for. Now, Tipu is a beautiful fully grown cat, with thick white fur, and lounges around in Iffrah’s house, knowing that he is in the right place. One can observe that the social stigma against pets and their lack of acceptance has considerably eased over the years. The trend of pet ownership has been on the rise, with more and more households having a pet animal living with them. However few owners actually understand their pet’s needs and provide the care, physical as well as emotional, that they should. Indeed, the most discussed topic in all the popular pet groups on Facebook is the pet’s breed. There are numerous threads where someone wants to adopt a pet, but only if it is a certain breed. Which leads to the question, are pets a status symbol? Sadly the deeper the matter is dug, the idea gains more credence. Threads where someone is putting up an animal for adoption – kittens mostly, since cats have greater acceptance as pets than dogs – the first inquiry, inevitably, is about their breed. And if the animal is a mongrel or a stray, the thread goes cold very soon. Pedigreed animals, on the other hand, are in high demand, readily being bought and sold, often for unbelievable sums. This breed-motivated attitude of owners thus confirms that the pet culture is primarily driven not by animal love, but by status. The more expensive your pet’s breed, the greater your prestige amongst your social circle. A pet is a mere commodity like everything else, rather than a living being with feelings that thrives on affection. The desire for a pet is little more than a passing fancy, which doesn’t last for long once the pet has been procured. It is fussed over and flaunted for a few days, and then abandoned - either for the servants to tend, or given away for adoption – with heartless disregard for the animal’s emotional needs. As for its physical wellbeing, one frequently hears of ugly incidents where gross, callous neglect has led to painful disease, maiming and even death, of the animal. Iffrah herself has 63 dogs and 11 cats – all rescues. “I provide shelter to these animals, after there are rescued. Ninety percent of them are injured, or sick, or even survivors of stray killings, and sadly abandoned pets. The worst is when they have been abused by people. Those animals are not just physically hurt – they are psychologically hurt too.” She is currently building a shelter behind her house for her cats. She relates an incident where two fully grown dogs, grown to have trusted their owners, were abandoned by them in a desolate area. Picasso and Bholu now live in Iffrah’s shelter since months, and while Picasso has made friends with her, Bholu still does not trust any human, she says. “It’s just so sad, that they buy these beautiful dogs, and abandon them, just because they could not handle them. Such people should not buy pets.” Vet Ahmed who has his own home visit service, says that he sees the way how different people treat their pets. “I understand that not everyone can be an animal expert, but at least if they have a pet, they should find out more about it,” he says. “One click online can get you so much information. But people don’t bother. Those who can afford it, have their servants look after their pets. From cleaning up after them, to feeding them, or walks, I have seen mostly domestic help do these things, especially with dogs.” But Vet Saleem says that there has always been a love for animals and it is this fondness that has helped grow the market. Todd’s Welfare Society (TWS) run by Kiran Maheen whose main shelter is on Burki Road, is another such service. Kiran’s own dog Todd went missing one day leaving her extremely depressed. But what shocked her was when people told her to cheer up and get another. Mistreatment and abuse of pets and animals speaks volumes about our society. Psychologist Dr Fehmida says that people who abuse or mistreat animals are more likely to be involved in domestic violence too including towards children. A writ petition was filed last year by lawyer Izzat Fatima – about animal abuse. “Mainly the abuse is visible in a place like Tollinton Market, but if you see the abuse is everywhere,” she says.

2021-01-25T00:00:00Z,Protest held against animal cruelty,Protest held against animal cruelty - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1603427,"LAHORE: A protest was held at the Liberty Roundabout on Sunday against dog culling and general mistreatment of animals. The protesters, especially the pet owners and activists, held a peaceful sit-in, holding banners inscribed with slogans to raise awareness about cruelty to animals. One of the banners quoted the Islamabad High Court, “Animals are non-human citizens of Pakistan”. A recent case which they took up as an example of cruelty was the murder of a pet pit bull, called Chuck, in the DHA, and previous cases of the dogs, Bella and Kiki. The demonstrators said the ‘cold-blooded incident had forced them to wake up before their own beloved pets are killed and the killers get no punishment’. In order to express solidarity, other pet owners brought their pet pit bulls and made them stand next to a poster of Chuck. “We should not let their deaths go in vain,” said Ayeza Haider, the main organiser of the protest. “We stand for giving rights to all animals and stopping animal abuse of any kind. The government needs to stop this cold-blooded and relentless killing of street dogs.” Other activists said that they needed the upgraded animal welfare laws that give protection to the animals and punish the culprits. Abid Hafeez, an animal rights activist, termed the protest a commendable step that brought animal lovers and animal rescuers together in order to highlight one of the biggest issues concerning those who were voiceless. “It is of utmost importance to stop dog culling and animal abuse and awaken the government from a deep slumber on the issue,” he said. “The purpose of this protest is to call for an amendment to an old law, which gives no rights to stray animals. Animals should not be brutally murdered but provided TNVR (trap, neuter, vaccinate and release) procedure.” Both Hafeez and Ayeza said that instead of dog culling, there should be a more humane policy of ‘trap, neuter, vaccinate and release’ – something which has been approved by the World Health Organisation, and is practised around the world. Nauman Khawaja, an activist and pet owner, said that since the past five years he had made a plan to create awareness among the children by taking his pets to school. He encouraged other activists to follow the strategy as it had made a change. Khawaja himself had also recently lost his pet dog called Hatchi, the news of which had gone round instantly in pet circles. He is still searching for his pet. Speaking to the media, he said that only those (pet) dogs became aggressive that were restrained for a long time, without any human interaction.

The feast marks the country’s Elephant Day, celebrating elephants as a source of national pride and cultural identity for Thailand throughout its history, used for labour, transport and in battlefield triumphs by warriors and kings. “We, the elephant people, are hoping that the government will open up the country (soon) to welcome foreign tourists in order for them to bring in income so that we can pay for the elephant food and compensation for their handlers,” said Ittipan Kharwlamai, General Manager of the Royal Elephant Kraal and Village, an elephant camp, located north of Bangkok. “We hope that tourists will help us and all 3,800 (domesticated) elephants to survive,” he said. The tourism-reliant country has yet to lift a travel ban imposed last April to curb the outbreak, keeping most foreign travellers and investors away. Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy suffered its deepest slump in over two decades last year, when the number of foreign visitors plunged 83pc from nearly 40 million in 2019. Animal rights groups have long been calling for the elephant camps in Thailand to end animal shows and rides, branding the shows a form of animal abuse.

2021-04-02T00:00:00Z,How difficult is it to be a vegan in Pakistan?,How difficult is it to be a vegan in Pakistan? - Culture - Images,https://images.dawn.com/news/1186861/how-difficult-is-it-to-be-a-vegan-in-pakistan,"A few years ago, my sister went through an intense health nut phase. Before we knew it, we were making rounds to superstores and finding cartons of soy and almond milk. It didn’t take us long, however, to realise that entirely plant-based products that aren’t manufactured in Pakistan might be slightly expensive, so we moved on to the internet and looked up recipes to make our own soy milk at home. Just because our attempt at making soy milk failed didn’t mean everyone fails at making it. Besides, soy milk is not necessary for survival. The painstaking process of attempting to make our own soy milk was not only disastrous but also made me wonder how difficult and expensive it could potentially be for vegan people (whose diet completely consists of plant-based food) to have this lifestyle in Pakistan. A lot of Pakistani staples such as daal chawal and sabzi roti are meals that are either already vegan or can be very easily made vegan with a few tweaks. But when you're eating out, most Pakistani vegan food options usually sound like starters and sidelines instead of main courses. In recent years, a lot of Pakistanis have reduced their meat intake and resorted to a primarily vegetarian diet. This is reportedly because of the rising prices of meat and inability of many people to afford it. That is indicative of how eating plant-based meals is relatively inexpensive compared to meat-based meals. On the other hand, the fact that dairy alternatives are not manufactured locally means that swapping out dairy could be heavy on the pocket. A Pakistani vegan future potentially could be a sustainable and beautiful one with endless possibilities. Picture coconut milk raita, soy milk kheer and chai, sprawled across a dastarkhwan with vegetable and potato biryani. Very unfortunate for you if you’re team biryani without aalu but it's a beautiful sight to imagine nonetheless. A vegan is someone who doesn't eat any animals or animal products, like dairy. That means no milk, no butter and no honey. They differ from vegetarians, who don't eat meat but still consume animal products. Most vegans also subscribe to the philosophy of not using animal products in their daily lives as well. For example, they don't use products tested on animals nor do they use items crafted out of animal skin, such as leather. There are many reasons why one would want to go vegan. The appeal is very real, at least for me. The meat and dairy industries have huge carbon footprints and the environmental consequences of eating meat are major reasons for some people going vegan. Another rather obvious reason is the sympathy that people have for animals. If people are privileged enough to have a choice, they do not want to be part of a system that is cruel to animals. Additionally, some may speculate that the health risks associated with meat and dairy are not worth an omnivorous lifestyle. Although veganism doesn't have to be expensive, it is fairly well-known that being vegan might not be the cheapest and easiest thing in the world. Plant-based products should technically be cheaper but are actually more expensive because animal products are manufactured in bulk while vegan products are not. In order to gauge how difficult and expensive it is to be vegan in Pakistan, I decided to ask the handful of people around me that have successfully been vegan for a while. Pireh — sick of seeing animal abuse on social media — made the decision to go vegan two years ago. Her formula to stay on budget is fairly simple, she relies on whole-food options such as daal and sabzi. Alternatively, she cooks dishes like pasta and burgers at home while obviously making sure that any pre-made ingredients such as the uncooked pasta or burger buns don’t have animal products such as milk or eggs in them. She recommends the YouTube channel Cheap Lazy Vegan for recipe inspiration for anyone looking. “It never gets boring, I don’t think you ever run out of options,” she says. While Pireh doesn’t eat out a lot, vegetable shawarmas, aloo and daal bun kababs, Subway, salads and halwa puri do the trick for her. However, Pireh does acknowledge that it is hard to find substitutes for dairy products like chocolate and yoghurt. She explains that some things are inevitable, which is why being vegan can be emotionally overwhelming sometimes. That's why she recommends going vegetarian first for a while before making transitioning into veganism. Pireh’s suggestion is not uncommon. In fact, Z*, whose Instagram page @ethnicalveganism is entirely dedicated to being a vegan in Karachi also started researching veganism when they saw their father experiment with vegetarianism. “It was all about health fads and trying to motivate people to go vegan in order to lose weight, and that just is not viable,” Z says, highlighting an important issue that was initially linked to veganism. Back in 2014, when they started questioning the ethics of eating animal products, the fatphobic discourse was predominant. People furthering the rhetoric that one should go vegan to lose weight is harmful and can make individuals spiral into eating disorders, Z explains. “... the reason I have been able to remain vegan for five years with no hesitation or regrets is because I constantly reinforce the moral merits of veganism.” On July 1, Z will celebrate five years of veganism. They explain that the driving force behind their consistency has been the commitment to abstain from being part of animal suffering. Animal abuse is sometimes needless, Z says, pinpointing videos circulating on the internet showing disturbing examples of animal abuse such as millions of male chicks being ground up in Pakistan among other acts of cruelty. However, another important factor that has softened the journey for them is supportive friends and family, so if someone you’re close to is going vegan or is already vegan an easy pro tip would be to make sure they’re comfortable! Z says one of the functions they hope their Instagram page serves is that of an encouraging support group for this very reason. Z also acknowledges that some people might just have to accept animal suffering as a by-product due to their circumstances and reserves any judgement towards them. “It was a deeply intense and harrowing process for me to face what I was complicit in when researching what goes on at slaughterhouses and farms,” they recall. Z decided to go vegan “for my health, for reducing my personal carbon footprint, and for my conscience” and they don't regret it at all. While Z acknowledges that you basically can’t get purposeful vegan meat and cheese substitutes in Pakistan, and that soy milk can run out sometimes due to import issues, they revealed that we can find a lot of ""accidentally vegan"" products in Pakistani superstores. While margarine is readily available, Z suggests getting creative at home for other substitutes and gives us a few ideas: “Mushrooms or tofu or beans to substitute meat, ground flax to substitute eggs, and nuts to substitute milk and cheese.” Before going vegan, Z recommends getting blood tests done to make sure you don’t have deficiencies such as those of vitamins B-12 or D. While daal and sabzi are great alternatives, speciality vegan meals, like the ones you get abroad, are very expensive. They taste great, hurt the environment less and would be cheaper if demand increased. “I generally don't spend a lot on specialty vegan products, so the chanas, coconut milk, veggies, and rice I survive on are extremely cheap. People who are low income can definitely adapt their diets to veganism and create satisfying meals while spending less than they would if they were buying meat, milk, yogurt and cheese,"" says Z. ""That's one of the main things I set out to do with my account too: show people that making satisfying vegan meals is 100% possible. The best thing about our food is the spices, not the meat!” they say. As I’ve mentioned before, I did not see a lot of main courses on Pakistani restaurant menus that were explicitly vegan. Z surprised me when they mentioned that you can almost always get a meal successfully made vegan at a Pakistani restaurant. “There's always going to be rice and vegetables, or some pasta dish, all of which you can ask to be made vegan,” they say, alternatively suggesting getting creative and putting together different appetisers and side dishes. But while restaurants might have vegetable-based meals to offer, Saba raises a very valid point about not knowing whether those meals are cooked in butter or ghee. She spoke about the limited options when it comes to finding vegan food in Islamabad’s restaurants, with a few Chinese places that offer tofu dishes being the exception. With her conscience weighed down with thoughts of animal cruelty and motivation from some vegan family members, Saba went vegan more than a year ago. Having had vegan family members already, lack of family support was not an issue for her. Although she had to deal with some friends making jokes, all of her family and some of her friends are vegan now. Saba does not believe in finding substitutes for animal products. “We really need to break our addictions and change our taste buds,” she says, expressing her distaste for meat and dairy. She believes that said products are more expensive than fruit, vegetables, and grains anyway. “If you're someone who's looking for 'vegan processed stuff' then it can be quite expensive, maybe because the demand is limited for vegan products,” she explains. However, things are looking up as the vegan processed products that used to be expensive because they were imported are now starting to be locally manufactured. “The tofu I get is locally made by Chinese people who are here or Pakistani people here trained by the Chinese people,"" says Shandana, the brains behind VeganEats Islamabad. VeganEats is a vegan bakery and dessert store that was started in 2018. Shandana went vegetarian in 2006 and vegan in 2012 after reading research on animal cruelty in the meat industry and how the egg and dairy industries are complicit in that same cruelty. “I wouldn’t eat my own dog [so] I don’t see why it’s right to eat a chicken,” she analogises. Going to university in Boston, a liberal hub full of vegan options, made her believe that there was no excuse not to go vegan. “Initially, I read the information I found online but I said it won’t make a difference. I'm one person, but when I did further research about how my actions can make a difference, it also helped me with my decision,"" she says. ""There are apps out there where I put in the year I went vegetarian or the year I went vegan, and they help calculate the number of animals I’ve saved.” For her, that's a big motivator. One such app is The Vegan Calculator. The calculator borrows facts from Cowspiracy, an investigative film about the meat industry. When Shandana moved back to Pakistan in 2016, she missed having vegan desserts, which prompted her to start baking desserts for herself and her family. That eventually grew into her selling her goods at a farmer’s market. “People purchased it because it tasted good in spite of it being vegan. You’re not gonna know it's vegan unless I tell you it is.” She has some important things to point out about Pakistan and its relationship with animals and meat, including how meat is often tied to class. If you get rich, you want to consume more meat. “I think in Pakistan the most important thing that needs to change is how people see animals,"" she says. Referring to her pet, she says, ""She’s a street dog. We’ve had her since she was still a puppy. If she tries to get out people try to poison her or throw stones at her, so fundamentally that needs to change in Pakistan."" Another thing that needs to change, according to Shandana, is how veganism is considered something elite and western. ""Veganism is for everyone. My veganism is rooted in equality, in the idea that everyone has the right to life. Not just for the animals but also for everyone to have access to information.” She believes that there could potentially be a vegan future in Pakistan if more people had access to information and that veganism is cheap if done right. There is no arguing with the fact that right now, most of the information rests in the hands of the more privileged and she concedes to that saying, “There’s definitely [more] options for people with privilege and money, access to information and the luxury to care about what they’re consuming.” When I was looking into veganism in Pakistan, I couldn’t find too many narrative pieces about being a vegan and having to live here but the few stories I did find were quite the source of intrigue. My interest was piqued reading about Amna Bakhtiar’s experiences as a vegan from Australia visiting Pakistan, where she is originally from. I wanted to know how Pakistani vegans who live abroad get by when they travel to Pakistan, so I got in touch with a few. Tehreem visited Pakistan and stayed in Lahore and Gujranwala for around a month. Like Z, Tehreem also documents her vegan lifestyle on her Instagram, @ecojabi. Her feed has pictures of fruit, OPTP fries, sandwiches and home cooked meals ranging from kung pao noodles to kachnar — a vegetarian desi meal prepared using the flowers of orchid trees. Her family accommodated her diet and relatives prepared home-cooked vegetable meals for her. Tehreem thought her experience as a vegan in Pakistan was even easier than she thought. As most desi vegans agree, Tehreem believes South Asian cuisine has the best vegetable and bean dishes. That, coupled with non-dairy products readily available in Pakistan’s superstores, made her for a pleasant experience. Other vegans who live abroad but had to live in Pakistan such as Zaheem and Rabia had similar experiences. ""It worked out pretty well for me. There was an abundance of fruit on every corner and where I was staying had a whole bunch of fruit trees, so that was helpful as well,” says Rabia, who is transitioning into a fruitarian diet where most of her diet consists of fruit. It's safe to say that being a vegan in Pakistan isn't a piece of cake, but it isn't as difficult as it's often made out to be. While the changes can be overwhelming initially, they aren't monumental and won't always cost you and arm and a leg. With awareness, making full use of the resources available to you and your heart being in the right place, there may be a viable vegan future in Pakistan.

2021-04-06T00:00:00Z,Ayesha Chundrigar is vaccinating Karachi's dogs but she needs your help,Ayesha Chundrigar is vaccinating Karachi's dogs but she needs your help - Culture - Images,https://images.dawn.com/news/1186928,"Ayesha Chundrigar and her soldiers at ACF have taken to Karachi’s streets yet again, fighting their next battle, waving a banner reading “Save the Dogs”. The battle promises to be a tough one. The effort here is twofold. On one hand, ACF’s challenge is the common man, who is unaware, poverty-ridden and eccentric — a product of the generational trauma and aggression we know but too well here in the third world. The solution here is education. And on the other hand, they tackle the lazy, inefficient, and neglectful authorities who see no money or power in protecting stray animals, and hence no motivation. The solution here is…well, they're still looking for one. What we’re left with then, is a small team of devotees, stretched thin on the streets and along the nullahs of Karachi, making efforts they’re not sure will change the fate of stray dogs, but deeply motivated by the immediate impact they create. Images sat down with Chundrigar to discuss her latest campaign in which she neuters and vaccinates stray dogs. The fundamental philosophy here, as Chundrigar explained, is the idea that violence — which arises internally from the very human experiences of dissatisfaction, neglect, exploitation, and trauma — is passed on, human to human, generation to generation; by perpetuating the same aggression that breeds one’s own violence. A post shared by Churail Sarwat (@sarwatg) Psychology today has presented us with conclusive evidence that those who are subjected to harsh aggression are likelier to be aggressive themselves, with their frustrations often mounting up to expression in physical, sexual or emotional assault. Chunridgar, a student of psychology herself, understands this, and is dedicated to proceed with the caution that her effort requires. “Most of our work is going around talking to people, trying to help them understand that these dogs aren’t enemies. They’re just scared and threatened themselves. If you treat them with love and respect, you will see that they’re so playful and loving,” she said. In many cases, Chundrigar said these people are just grossly unaware. When she and her team enter neighborhoods to help dogs, the locals are often very co-operative. Seeing this group of dedicated men and women provides them with reason and motivation to help. And in several cases, stray dogs had been adopted by entire neighborhoods as pets. In some ways, just by being on the streets saving dogs, the people at ACF are humanising the population. One can only imagine how the changes such efforts are bringing in their hearts reflect positively in their personal lives. “When they see all these women in a group walking through the streets, chasing dogs, and our team members getting dirty going down in nullahs or wastelands, the locals come in and help us. They see us working, and want to contribute. They sometime bring us drinks and refreshments.” A post shared by Churail Sarwat (@sarwatg) However, that is not to say that dogs (or any animal for that matter) are particularly safe and loved in our society. It’s a positive anecdote, but it doesn’t explain why the vast majority of our dogs are either malnourished and dying, or dead already. “I have, with my own eyes, seen someone kick a sleeping dog while passing by on their motorbike. I’ve seen people throw stones at them, hurting them brutally.” Chundrigar puts the problem down to the perception of dogs in our culture, urging the need to change this. “These are stray dogs, their homes are the streets. Sure we must neuter and vaccinate them, but then we should send them back,” she emphasised, finishing with “They will live their lives on the streets, it’s where they belong.” Under Save The Dogs, the ACF team visits a neighborhood where their ""reporters"" have already told them about the presence of a pack of dogs. They have some idea before going down there, like a general estimate of their number, health conditions and possible threats. The real work though, begins once they reach the site. They must then observe the pack and learn about them to tackle the problem effectively. “In most cases it is the alpha dog that is violent and creating problems. We have, in our experience, learnt that extracting the alpha from the pack always helps. We have a special facility where we take them, but it’s not a permanent solution. The solution is neutering and vaccinating these dogs, so that they can go back on the streets” she explained. They also collect females and healthy puppies from neighborhoods and bring them temporarily into their facility provided by a generous donor to protect them. Under the same Save The Dogs campaign, they have also been vaccinating dogs and tagging them with neon green collars provided by the Indus Hospital. These dogs are then let back on the streets. A post shared by Churail Sarwat (@sarwatg) Culling, or slaughter as it should rightfully be called, does strike a chord with Chundrigar. I could sense a genuine change in her voice when we got to this stage of the conversation. “We are seeing that they’re poisoning our vaccinated dogs. Why would anyone do this? Why would they kill an animal?” Chundrigar continually pressed on the urgency to initiate dialogue, to help bring about awareness among people. “They aren’t bad people. In many cases, they just don’t know any better,” she said of ordinary people who hurt animals on the streets. She believes we must initiate a conversation with these people humbly, by understanding other people and tailoring our points to them therefore humanising them in the process. There is no moral high ground in knowing better as a result of privilege, we agree, and assuming one only to put someone down is an act of great cowardice. If you want to help Ayesha Chundrigar and her friends at ACF, four-legged or otherwise, you can share their social media content. “We put in great effort into our content. We try not to make it too preachy or self-righteous, and instead try to make them jolly and full of smiles. It does get ugly at times, but we must raise awareness. It’s our job.” Their work is tedious, laboursome and capital intensive. You can always help them financially, though if you can’t make such a contribution, but still wish to contribute, volunteer!

fighting their next battle waving a banner reading save the dogs the battle promises to be a tough one the effort here is twofold on one hand acf s challenge is the common man who is unaware poverty ridden and eccentric a product of the generational trauma and aggression we know but too well here in the third world the solution here is education and on the other hand they tackle the lazy inefficient and neglectful authorities who see no money or power in protecting stray animals and hence no motivation the solution here is well they re still looking for one what we re left with then is a small team of devotees stretched thin on the streets and along the nullahs of karachi making efforts they re not sure will change the fate of stray dogs but deeply motivated by the immediate impact they create images sat down with chundrigar to discuss her latest campaign in which she neuters and vaccinates stray dogs the fundamental philosophy here as chundrigar explained is the idea that violence which arises internally from the very human experiences of dissatisfaction neglect exploitation and trauma is passed on human to human generation to generation by perpetuating the same aggression that breeds one s own violence a post shared by churail sarwat sarwatg psychology today has presented us with conclusive evidence that those who are subjected to harsh aggression are likelier to be aggressive themselves with their frustrations often mounting up to expression in physical sexual or emotional assault chunridgar a student of psychology herself understands this and is dedicated to proceed with the caution that her effort requires most of our work is going around talking to people trying to help them understand that these dogs aren t enemies they re just scared and threatened themselves if you treat them with love and respect you will see that they re so playful and loving she said in many cases chundrigar said these people are just grossly unaware when she and her team enter neighborhoods to help dogs the locals are often very co operative seeing this group of dedicated men and women provides them with reason and motivation to help and in several cases stray dogs had been adopted by entire neighborhoods as pets in some ways just by being on the streets saving dogs the people at acf are humanising the population one can only imagine how the changes such efforts are bringing in their hearts reflect positively in their personal lives when they see all these women in a group walking through the streets chasing dogs and our team members getting dirty going down in nullahs or wastelands the locals come in and help us they see us working and want to contribute they sometime bring us drinks and refreshments a post shared by churail sarwat

He added that the lion was around 14 to 15 years old and was brought to Karachi Zoo from Africa in 2012.

Karachi Administrator Barrister Murtaza Wahab has, meanwhile, sought a report on the lion's death. Expressing grief over the incident, Wahab pointed out that white lions were a rare breed, and that ""strict disciplinary action will be taken against the zoo management if any negligence is found after the cause of the lion's death comes to light."" The news of the lion's death comes a day after the video of a starving lion, allegedly located at the Karachi Zoo, was widely shared on social media, prompting outrage. The video of the starving lion was originally shared by Geo TV and ARY News online and led many to question whether enough food was being supplied to the animals at the zoo. However, in response to the outcry on social media, the KMC maintained that all animals at Karachi Zoo were healthy and being provided proper feed. KMC spokesperson Ali Hasan Sajid had told Dawn that a special team had visited Karachi Zoo on Tuesday and got information about the food provided to the animals.

The RJ and actor collected some ""horrific stories"" of men who faced abuse as children and adults, and decided to post as many as she could fit in a multi-share Instagram post. Issuing a trigger warning for mention of abuse and rape, the actor highlighted how the matter is usually swept under the rug and how parents need to educate their children on their bodies and respecting others' bodies. ""I usually talk about women’s issues but this May I finally decided to also highlight #mensmentalhealth which is key to a stable society. Young boys are often bullied and abused in schools, at home or by madrasahs which is why I insist there is NO need for clergy in religion. ""These posts have been shared by some very brave men. Ones I’d like to appreciate by letting them know how much respect they have in my eyes. Despite their abuse and trauma, they’re choosing to be better people. They’re actively working on themselves to be okay,"" the actor captioned the post. A post shared by Churail Sarwat (@sarwatg) Ashraf said men reaching out for help shouldn’t only be accepted but encouraged. She said the purpose of sharing these stories was ""to shed light on what goes on with the vulnerable throughout the world"". She also wanted the reader to understand that just because they didn't personally go through it, doesn’t give them the right to dismiss someone else's experience by saying it’s in their head. She asked people to stop victim shaming, be supportive and listen instead. She addressed parents so the issue can be targeted at the root, stressing the importance of teaching children the necessity of respecting their own bodies as well as those of other people. ""Also, teach your sons and daughters the rights they have over their own bodies and the lack of rights they have over others' bodies. Start young. It’s an awful world and even though we like shoving all matters as such under the carpet, the carpet is wearing out with all that filth beneath. Clean it up. Our children will shape this nations future, they cannot start their lives on such a footing while parents turn the other way."" Ashraf said this was just a fraction of the stories that have accumulated in her inbox. She asked her followers to share them on their story so more people can access them. She added the hashtags #mensmentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness. It is commendable to see someone shed light on an issue that's not talked about enough.

2022-05-26T00:00:00Z,Pet owners panic as cat and dog food lands on list of banned imported goods,Pet owners panic as cat and dog food lands on list of banned imported goods - Culture - Images,https://images.dawn.com/news/1190147/pet-owners-panic-as-cat-and-dog-food-lands-on-list-of-banned-imported-goods,"Pet parents around Pakistan have been shaken by news that their beloved pets' food is on the list of banned imported goods announced by the government on Thursday as part of its Import Policy Order. For many pet owners, the situation isn't as easy as switching to another brand because their often fussy or senior pets have already adjusted to particular brands of food over the years and are unlikely to take to local alternatives. Many pet food providers and pet owners have taken to different online platforms to address the issue, asking for healthy local alternatives that offer high quality ingredients. After eating a particular brand for years, you wouldn't be too keen to shift to another brand in a week, and neither are pets. Cats and dogs in Pakistan have been eating expensive and healthy food by brands Royal Canin, NutraGold, Purina, Pedigree, SmartHeart, Reflex, Josera, Taste of the Wild and Mera for many years. Shan Saleem, who runs pet food and supplies shop Pet Smart with his RPK Critter Care Hospital in Karachi's Nishat Commercial, told Images that the ban has created panic and is being taken in a ""negative way"" instead of being taken positively. “The ban is negative in the sense that importers have already dispatched the supply to different retailers and have more orders lined up which won't stop. The payment for containers on-board are on the way so for five to six months there won't be any shortfall,” he said. “But what came with this import ban is negative marketing that the stock has ended. Everything is being sold in the black market by importers and wholesalers who have increased the rates and removed a lot of products from the shelves to sell these products in black,” he explained, mentioning that in the next few months it's unlikely that stocks will run out. Saleem also said that the current situation has scared consumers and so a person who only needs one bag or perhaps two is purchasing six to eight bags. ""The thing we used to buy at Rs12,000 is now at Rs15,000 to Rs16,000, with an increase of Rs5,000 per bag. Just imagine the loss a consumer has to face when one single bag costs twice as much as before? If a container carries 600 to 700 bags, and a single bag has increased by Rs4,000...we're talking about millions being at stake,"" he said. According to Saleem, people are being misguided to cause a scene in order to take advantage of a person's need. He said consumers are being ripped off, but he wasn't too sure of the alternatives. ""Unfortunately the local industry has failed to maintain the quality of food. The local market suffers because the price is similar to the imported one but the quality is way below that even the pets refuse to eat it,"" he said. Abdul Rafay Irfan, general manager of Pawltoo, a pet food and accessories retailer, told Images that the ban is ""temporary"" and will soon be over. ""For example, take EffeEffe, Lavital, Econature and Pronature that we import. They are almost 30 years old. They have spent millions of dollars into R&D and have now reached a stage where these products are safe and healthy for our pets. They have hi-tech facilities and are maintaining the production quality in European standards. So how can we expect our local food to compete with such products?"" he asked. For Irfan, what's important at this time is creating an awareness campaign through which people realise that pet food isn't a luxury — it's a necessity. ""The food that's being imported annually is very less in volume. Many more luxury products that are being imported in larger volumes should be banned and local alternatives should be arranged for those but pet food isn't one of them. Most people don't even know the rights of animals here so how will they understand the need for pet food?"" he demanded. Healthy Tails, a pet hospital and retailer in Karachi, said that they have limited stock available now but they plan on keeping some of it in reserves for senior pets in need. On the other hand Dr Abrar Pirzada of Pirzada Pets Clinic was of a different view. “If there is a ban on imported pet food, it will prove to be good for pets in the long-run because fresh home-made food is good for your pets,” he told Dawn. “I have a cat coming to me who is 27 years old and she is so healthy because she is fed clean home-made chicken and mutton. Your pets, be they cats or dogs, live longer on fresh food. Now after the impending ban I also have worried pet owners coming in, saying that pet food is not a luxury but a necessity. But I am telling them that it is a luxury and a convenient way for them to quickly feed their pet and be done with it. Honestly, your pets will be better off if you offer them home-made meals,” he insisted. When informed that some pets absolutely refuse to have anything else but the packaged imported food, the senior vet said that many imported pet foods carry addictive substances making the animal addicted to them. “Believe me, it is happening. It might take time to get them off the food they are so used to eating but you can do it,” he said encouragingly. That said, he added that there were, however, certain medicated pet food varieties that some animals with liver and kidney conditions might need. “But again, those, too, have alternatives. My father, who started our pets’ clinic some 58 years ago, can educate you more on that. There used to be a time when there was no imported pet food the pets used to have no other choice but to eat healthy wholesome homemade meals,” he pointed. The ban on pet food caused an uproar online on platforms such as Pet Talk, a Facebook group for discussions about pet food, vets, boarders and treats. While many were protesting against the ban, some asked about local brands that cater to both dogs and cats. We were able to find few named Waggles, Purrs and Woof. Rafae Dossal, founder and CEO Waggles Pet Foods Limited, told Images that his start-up was founded in early 2020 and is now a full-fledged pet food production company that will be exporting to the UAE staring this July. ""We started with natural recipes that are simple and uncomplicated while being complete and balanced for pets. We only use 100 per cent whole-food natural ingredients in our recipes that are minimally processed to retain essential nutrients. ""Initially, we launched our dog food recipe range, and then started Purrs, our cat food line of products. The pet food segment is rapidly growing in Pakistan, almost at the rate of 20 per cent segment growth per year,"" Dossal explained. As of now, the brand offers wet food recipes for both dogs and cats and is soon going to launch a dry food line. Waggles is currently operating at a ""1,200 tonne annual production capacity with a facility that is ISO certified"". According to Dossal, Waggles is an omnichannel retail brand that retails via traditional retail stores, online stores like Daraz and their own website. This means they deliver all across Pakistan in 45 different cities. Dossal also said that pet parents are ""sceptical of trying out new brands with their pets due to questions and concerns over product quality and ingredient usage etc"" and agreed that introducing a new food brand can indeed be tricky. While he understands pet owners' concerns around local brands, as the owner of Waggles, Dossal is offering owners the chance to sign up for a sample for their pet to try out. All you have to do is fill out details such as your name, email, shipping address, pet (cat or dog), pet's name, breed and age in order for the product to arrive at your doorstep. Cats, dogs and pets in general form their flavour preference after years of having a certain type of food. While many argue that a healthy option such as boiled chicken or meat is the way to go, some pets often prefer cookies or biscuits on the side to nibble on. But these cookies aren't always a treat — some pets need to eat them for health reasons or dietary restrictions. While we understand the need to reduce imports, pet food isn't a luxury item and shouldn't be on the list. Pets are living breathing beings and should be given access to food they can eat and prefer. Over time, their digestive system adjusts to what they've been eating. Why is pet food being considered a luxury when it's a basic need for a living being?",2025-11-15,pet parents around pakistan have been shaken by news that their beloved pets food is on the list of banned imported goods announced by the government on thursday as part of its import policy order for many pet owners the situation isn t as easy as switching to another brand because their often fussy or senior pets have already adjusted to particular brands of food over the years and are unlikely to take to local alternatives many pet food providers and pet owners have taken to different online platforms to address the issue asking for healthy local alternatives that offer high quality ingredients after eating a particular brand for years you wouldn t be too keen to shift to another brand in

for many years shan saleem who runs pet food and supplies shop pet smart with his rpk critter care hospital in karachi s nishat commercial told images that the ban has created panic and is being taken in a negative way instead of being taken positively the ban is negative in the sense that importers have already dispatched the supply to different retailers and have more orders lined up which won t stop the payment for containers on board are on the way so for five to six months there won t be any shortfall he said but what came with this import ban is negative marketing that the stock has ended everything is being sold in the black market by importers and wholesalers who have increased the rates and removed a lot of products from the shelves to sell these products in black he explained mentioning that in the next few months it s unlikely that stocks will run out saleem also said that the current situation has scared consumers and so a person who only needs one bag or perhaps two is purchasing six to eight bags the thing we used to buy at rs is now at rs to rs with an increase of rs per bag just imagine the loss a consumer has to face when one single bag costs twice as much as before if a container carries to bags and a single bag has increased by rs we re talking about millions being at stake he said according to saleem people are being misguided to cause a scene in order to take advantage of a person s need he said consumers are being ripped off but he wasn t too sure of the alternatives unfortunately the local industry has failed to maintain the quality of food the local market suffers because the price is similar to the imported one but the quality is way below that even the pets refuse to eat it he said abdul rafay irfan general manager of pawltoo a pet food and accessories retailer told images that the ban is temporary and will soon be over for example take effeeffe lavital econature and pronature that we import they are almost years old they have spent millions of dollars into r d and have now reached a stage where these products are safe and healthy for our pets they have hi tech facilities and are maintaining the production quality in european standards so how can we expect our local food to compete with such products he asked for irfan what s important at this time is creating an awareness campaign through which people realise that pet food isn t a luxury it s a necessity the food that s being imported annually is very less in volume many more luxury products that are being imported in larger volumes should be banned and local alternatives should be arranged for those but pet food isn t one of them most people don t even know the rights of animals here so how will they understand the need for pet food he demanded healthy

2022-12-03T00:00:00Z,Pakistan's first animal rights curriculum to be launched ahead of Animal Rights Day,Pakistan’s first animal rights curriculum to be launched ahead of Animal Rights Day - Culture - Images,https://images.dawn.com/news/1191247,"PM Shehbaz Sharif’s Strategic Reforms Unit just announced that a special curriculum designed to educate children on animal rights will be launched on December 9, prior to International Animal Rights Day. It will teach kids about the responsibility of keeping pets and to treat stray animals with compassion. On Thursday, Head of PM’s Strategic Reforms Salman Sufi shared an update on Twitter. “It’s almost time. On directions of PM Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan’s first curriculum on animal rights will be launched on International Animal Rights Day. Will be sharing event details for online participation few days before the event,” he added. Attached to his tweet was a poster that revealed that the course will be taught at primary level in private and public institutes of Islamabad during phase one. Sufi told Images what prompted the inclusion of this course in the curriculum. “Basically, the point of adding the curriculum about animal welfare and animal well being in children’s textbooks, [as per] the direction of the PM, [was] because he was concerned about the growing intolerance in society. It is very important that our children learn compassion and tolerance that, unfortunately, our generation does not [have],” he said. He added that this is just the first initiative of many to come. “[The PM] has also directed [us] to add chapters about humanity, about other aspects which teach our children how to be more accessible and tolerating of dissent, and most importantly, how to take care of the most vulnerable. Animals are [included in that] because of [children’s] natural affinity with animals since childhood.” He talked about what the course consists of. “The course has many components, it teaches children that animal rights are much stressed [upon] in Islam as well. We will be giving examples of our Prophet Muhammad PBUH, of other figures as well. We will be giving them examples of what kinds of animals are there, how to take care of them and how to make sure stray animals are not harmed,” he said. “The chapter will be requested to be rolled out in other provinces after the ICT launch. Our next goal is to have it in all languages — Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, Siraiki, Hindko and other languages being spoken in Pakistan. We will be translating it and spreading it across Pakistan.” Sufi had introduced the idea of the course in September saying, “It will primarily be included in a subject but we are still figuring out which subject and the chapters.” He elaborated that the course would have co-curricular sessions as well and added animal rights activists will visit schools and teach children about keeping pets. They will tell kids that pets cannot just be kept for fun, and make them realise that animals are a responsibility. “And with every class, the depth of the course will increase,” he added. Apart from pets, Sufi went on, students will also be taught about stray animals. “They need to understand that they cannot throw stones at stray dogs… even Islam teaches us to respect every living being and emphasises how animals should be protected.” Animal rights are a matter of serious concern in Pakistan where zoo culture can be very toxic and stray animals are treated with little to no dignity. Recently, comedian Ali Gul Pir opened up about a traumatic experience he had during his teenage years where he saw youngsters aged 14 or 15 dragging a dog, beating him and laughing. He talked about the most disturbing part being that the perpetrators were children.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) condemned the death of a horse on the sets of Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, calling out the producers for exploiting animals for their art. On Sunday, Amazon Studios acknowledged the passing away of the horse in an official statement, attributing it to cardiac arrest. “We are deeply saddened to confirm that a production horse died on March 21,” said an Amazon spokesperson. “The incident took place in the morning whilst the horse was being exercised prior to rehearsals. The trainer was not in costume and filming had yet to commence. Both a veterinarian and a representative of the American Humane Association were present at the time. The independent necropsy has confirmed that the horse died of cardiac failure.” Peta was quick to issue a statement of its own, denouncing the incident and the general use of animals in production. “It seems that living underground with the orcs is par for the course for the producers of The Rings of Power, because they have the option to use CGI, mechanical rigs and other humane methods that wouldn’t run vulnerable horses to death on set,” Peta senior vice president Lisa Lange told Variety. “Peta is calling on the show’s creators — and all other producers — to take on a new quest without using any real horses. If they can’t avoid exploiting animals for their art, they should find a new medium, because no one wants to see a spinoff for TV with torment as the theme.” The organisation’s strong reaction is not based on one incident — there has been a history of horses dying on set. It released a similar statement last year in July following the death of a horse on The Gilded Age’s sets. HBO said that the stallion “likely died of natural causes, according to a veterinarian’s preliminary findings”. Lord of the Rings prequel The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was also criticised after three horses died on set, along with some other animals.

2023-04-20T00:00:00Z,Animal Abuse,ANIMAL ABUSE - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1748653,"ANIMAL ABUSE: It is indeed commendable that saner voices against animal abuse, especially on social media, are being raised in Pakistan. However, more needs to be done. The hunting of animals or birds should be banned, and animals should not be used as a means of transportation. Animal abuse is a very serious issue that is unfortunately taken lightly. Syed Zohaib Rizvi Karachi OUT OF REACH: With petroleum prices having gone out of reach of the common man long ago, people in Makran were used to buying Iranian petrol that was sold at a price as low as Rs160 per litre. This has been an open secret for years. Today, even that ‘facility’ has been snatched away as the dealers have increased the price up to Rs250 per litre. The locals are unable to buy even Iranian fuel, and that has brought the transportation scene to a standstill. Among other things, the situation has adversely affected the academic life in the province. The authorities concerned cannot do anything about the regular petrol prices, but they can do a lot in terms of keeping an eye on the parallel market. Meher Ullah Jameel Turbat STRAY DOGS: The increasing number of stray dogs on the streets of Karachi is becoming alarming day by day. People remain in fear as instances of dog-bite have been on the rise for some time. The absence of anti-rabies vaccine is an element of additional concern in this regard. Manahil Tariq Karachi TEHSIL STATUS: There is talk in the air about Mashkay tehsil being excluded from the jurisdiction of Awaran district. The locals do not have an issue with the possible separation from Awaran, but they are concerned about their future.

However, I regret that people are selective in kindness towards animals. While most of us are affectionate towards some animals, we do not show the same compassion towards others, especially stray dogs. Recently, a stray dog was shot to death by someone in our neighbourhood who wanted to get rid of the poor creature. This horrible incident left me upset and wondering about the selective empathy we show towards animals. While it is true that stray dogs can be harmful to humans, they certainly do not deserve to be killed this way. In fact, no animal deserves this cruel treatment. The humane way to get rid of stray animals is to relocate them to a place where they may have access to food, safety and shelter. I urge the government as well as the general public to speak up against this cruel treatment, and ensure that stray animals are not killed or tortured mercilessly. If required, animal care centres should be contacted for taking them away. There are a few of them around, but we surely need more such centres in Pakistan.

2023-06-14T00:00:00Z,Animal Sanctuaries,Animal sanctuaries - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1759663/animal-sanctuaries,"A RECENT issue of the famed National Geographic magazine cited elephant as one of the most intelligent animals on earth. It was an excellent coverage, raising mass awareness towards these majestic animals living in the wild, or around human civilisations. This brings us to take a closer look at the demise of a young elephant in Karachi. It was captured in Tanzania, and was kept at the zoo in Karachi that lacked the expertise required to care for these animals. This was a tragedy that should not have been allowed to happen. A lot of grief over the incident and anger against the zoo management was expressed on conventional and social media platforms. Tragedies like this have happened before and zoo managements have been blamed afterwards. Calls for reforms are made, but then everyone seems to forget them, and animal abuse continues in the zoos. A fundamental problem is the perception of our relationship with animals, in general, and zoo animals, in particular. We see zoo animals as a source of entertainment, a notion that robs animals of their dignity and lifestyle conducive to their needs. Such views of course lead to bigger issues that Australian philosopher Peter Singer in his 1975 classic, Animal Liberation: A New Ethics for Our Treatment of Animals, called speciesism; a prejudice against animals that is not different from the prejudices of racism and sexism that we abhor in this day and age. Zoos are not the place for animals, and, as we are encroaching on their habitats, we need to build them proper sanctuaries where the animals may live a life that is closest to their natural habitats and needs. They surely deserve that much, and we surely need to provide that.

2023-08-31T00:00:00Z,Karachi Zoo lone 'beneficiary' of dramatic lion rescue,Karachi Zoo lone ‘beneficiary’ of dramatic lion rescue - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1773103,"KARACHI: As the law started to take its course in the lion’s case on Wednesday that saw five suspects being granted bail by a court, experts raised concern over the well-being of the big cat that was rescued, along with a tortoise a day earlier, from Sharea Faisal and moved to the Karachi Zoological Garden late Tuesday night. Sources said the big male cat was around one year old and had been raised as a pet, though illegally. “It seems to be highly tamed as he didn’t inflict serious injuries to anyone during the operation. This is why it’s important that he is handled with due care and attention. Unfortunately, the zoo lacks trained staff and this may affect his health,” a zoo official said, wishing not to be named. According to him, the zoo is the lone beneficiary from the dramatic operation carried out on the city’s busiest road a day earlier. “The zoo has gotten a young lion without spending a single penny. If looked after well, the newcomer may help the facility increase the number of its big cats,” he said, adding that the zoo was left with two lionesses (of Panthera Leo species) after losing the lone male member last year. Concerns raised over welfare of ‘pet’ big cat spending rest of its life in zoo Sources said the first day was tough for the visibly depressed lion as he remained confined to a corner of its cage almost the whole day despite getting a lot of media attention. “He hardly moved and apparently ate very little today. The people responsible for his fate are out on bail while the poor animal is likely to spend rest of his life at a facility that doesn’t offer good care to its inmates, resulting in frequent disease outbreaks and mortalities,” another zoo official shared. According to sources, the zoo has been hosting traumatised rescued animals for decades since the wildlife department doesn’t have a dedicated facility for such animals. “There is a long list of animals that were brought here (by the wildlife department) and passed away in few years. Often such animals were kept in poor conditions and there are mortalities during operations,” an expert said, emphasising the need for inducting more staff at the zoo and providing them with the much-needed training in animal care. He also expressed the possibility of animal abuse at the hands of lion’s handlers and said that there should be a complete physical examination of the lion that’s possible only after sedating him. “Big cats are instinctively ferocious. Often, these animals are declawed and made fangless by their handlers raising them in illegal captivity. This cruel practice makes them vulnerable to infections and they are stated to have shorter lifespan than their counterparts in the wild.” Zoo director Iqbal Nawaz wasn’t available for a comment despite repeated attempts made by this reporter to contact him. Speaking to Dawn, Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Maher agreed with concerns regarding welfare of rescued animals and said that the province needed a rehab facility for rescued animals. “We are gradually moving towards that direction. The first step was to have an updated law that provides protection to all species and covers related sensitivities and that we have achieved. Now, it’s in the enforcement phase,” he said. Efforts, he said, were underway to identify people illegally keeping big cats and other animals in captivity and that, too, in residential areas. According to officials, Sindh is the first province in the country to enact a new wildlife law three years ago — called the Sindh Wildlife Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management Act 2020 — to protect 326 species of birds, 107 species of crawling animals and 82 species of other animals. Under the act, the lawful possession of any wildlife species has been attached with several stringent conditions, unlike the past practice of granting a two-liner official permit for setting up a mini-zoo, and that too without mentioning any specific species. For instance, lawfully possessing exotic big cats is attached with 39 conditions, including one under which the owner is required to get the DNA certification for the animal, which can only be done at a handful of institutes across the country. Besides, under the 2020 law, no new application for importing big cats will be entertained. The permit also bars citizens from keeping big cats in residential areas, and an applicant must acquire a no-objection certificate from the relevant union council, town committee and cantonment board. A sessions court on Wednesday granted bail to the owner of a young lion and his four employees against a surety bond of Rs200,000 each. They were booked in a case registered by the Sindh wildlife protection police over violations of Sections 21 (protection of wildlife), 32 (seizure of property being wildlife species), 49 (certificate of lawful possession) and 50 (lawful possession of wildlife species) of the Act. — Additional reporting by Naeem Sahoutara and Imtiaz Ali Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2023",2025-11-15,karachi as the law started to take its course in the lion s case on wednesday that saw five suspects being granted bail by a court experts raised concern over the well being of the big cat that was rescued along with a tortoise a day earlier from sharea faisal and moved to the karachi zoological garden late tuesday night sources said the big male cat was around one year old and had been raised as a pet though illegally it seems to be highly tamed as he didn t inflict serious injuries to anyone during the operation this is why it s important that he is handled with due care and attention unfortunately the zoo lacks trained staff and this may affect his health a zoo official said wishing not to be named according to him the zoo is the lone beneficiary from the dramatic operation carried out on the city s busiest road a day earlier the zoo has gotten a young lion without spending a single penny if looked after well the newcomer may help the facility increase the number of its big cats he said adding that the zoo was left with two lionesses of panthera leo species after losing the lone male member last year concerns raised over welfare of pet big cat spending rest of its life in zoo sources said the first day was tough for the visibly depressed lion as he remained confined to a corner of its cage almost the whole day despite getting a lot of media attention he hardly moved and apparently ate very little today the people responsible for his fate are out on bail while the poor animal is likely to spend rest of his life at a facility that doesn t offer good care to its inmates resulting in frequent disease outbreaks and mortalities another zoo official shared according to sources the zoo has been hosting traumatised rescued animals for decades since the wildlife department doesn t have a dedicated facility for such animals there is a long list of animals that were brought here by the wildlife department and passed away in few years often such animals were kept in poor conditions and there are mortalities during operations an expert said emphasising the need for inducting more staff at the zoo and providing them with the much needed training in animal care he also expressed the possibility of animal abuse at the hands of lion s handlers and said that there should be a complete physical examination of the lion that s possible only after sedating him big cats are instinctively ferocious often these animals are declawed and made fangless by their handlers raising them in illegal captivity this cruel practice makes them vulnerable to infections and they are stated to have shorter lifespan than their counterparts in the wild zoo director iqbal nawaz wasn t available for a comment despite repeated attempts made by this reporter to contact him speaking to dawn sindh wildlife conservator javed ahmed maher agreed with concerns regarding welfare of rescued animals and said that the province needed a rehab facility for rescued animals we are gradually moving towards

2023-09-09T00:00:00Z,Govt plans to upgrade archaic animal welfare laws,Govt plans to upgrade archaic animal welfare laws - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1710764,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to put an end to animal abuse and raise awareness among citizens, the prime minister’s Strategic Reforms Unit has planned a comprehensive law pertaining to animal welfare that aims to revisit centuries-old laws regarding animals besides “strict regulations” to discourage the import of exotic animals. The head of the reforms unit, Salman Sufi, told Dawn that his department along with the climate change ministry was working on the law for the welfare of animals in Pakistan as the country had become a “horrible place” for these creatures. He added that his department will propose a ban on the keeping of exotic animals as pets in the federal territory which will then be sent to the prime minister for approval. In the first stage, the said law will be implemented in the federal capital and then provinces would be asked to replicate it as well,” Mr Sufi said and added that inputs from stakeholders were being sought to make the law more comprehensive. Strict regulations regarding exotic animals, potential ban on the cards; children to be taught about animal welfare, stray animals at Islamabad schools He lamented the obsolete laws regarding animal welfare in Pakistan and said the existing rules from the 1800s were outdated – there is only a Rs50 fine for anyone who mistreats animals. ‘Special course’ In a tweet, Salman Sufi also said the government was preparing a “special course” on animal welfare for schools in Islamabad which would teach them compassion and a humane approach toward animals. The course, which would be introduced in educational institutions by the end of October, had already been chalked out, he said. It will primarily be included in a subject but we are still figuring out which subject and the chapters,” he said, revealing that the course will be introduced “according to the intensity of the curriculum” and will be taught to classes starting from the fifth grade in both private and government schools. Mr Sufi elaborated that the course would have co-curricular sessions as well and added animal rights activists will visit schools and teach children about keeping pets. They will tell kids that pets cannot just be kept for fun, and make them realise that animals are a responsibility, he added. “And with every class, the depth of the course will increase,” he added. Apart from pets, Sufi went on, students will also be taught about stray animals. “They need to understand that they cannot throw stones at stray dogs… even Islam teaches us to respect every living being and emphasises how animals should be protected.” Exotic animals The law would also have strict regulations in terms of keeping exotic animals as pets. “People will not be able to keep a lion in a one kanal house and will require a much bigger space for the wild animal to roam around,” said Salman Sufi. He, however, hinted that his department will try to get the practice banned. “We will tell children that if they can afford these wild animals, it is absolutely unfair to keep them at home and that importing exotic animals is a big no,” Mr Sufi stressed, pointing out that the government was also in touch with international organisations and local activists regarding the projects. Himalayan bear rescued Separately, the Punjab Wildlife Department rescued a “female dancing bear” from the streets on a tip-off by locals. “The Himalayan black bear, nearly two years old, and her handler were presented in the court in Gujar Khan before being handed over to the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB). The handler was fined Rs10,000,” District Wildlife Officer Punjab Wildlife Department Rizwana Aziz told Dawn. According to the official, the canines of the bear had been extracted but she was in good health. Ms Aziz said her office had also been responding to reports of killing and injuring livestock by a leopard in parts of Kahuta. One goat was killed and two others were wounded as they grazed in the nearby forest, the official said, adding that there were no complaints by villagers in this regard. However, the Punjab Wildlife Department had already initiated an awareness campaign pertinent to human-leopard conflict in potential rural areas of Kahuta tehsil, Rawalpindi.

2023-10-01T00:00:00Z,Psychological effects on children exposed to animal abuse,Psychological effects on children exposed to animal abuse - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1778655/psychological-effects-on-children-exposed-to-animal-abuse,"Do Pakistanis know the United Nations (UN) just said children should not be exposed to animal abuse? Probably not, because there have been no local media reports about it. While several developed countries have long established the undeniable cyclical link between animal abuse, human abuse, crimes and domestic violence and how it affects children, Pakistanis sneer that animal welfare and rights are not worthy of recognition. The fact that Pakistan has laws for animals but no lawyers who specialise in animal rights (except for Hira Jaleel, who now resides in the US) also speaks volumes about the matter. The modern world rejoiced on August 30 when the UN Committee on the ‘Rights of the Child’ made the historic announcement that children must be protected from all forms of violence and exposure to it, including violence against animals. Its guide, ‘General Comment No 26’, states, “Children must be protected from all forms of physical and psychological violence and from exposure to violence, such as domestic violence or violence inflicted on animals.” Pakistan is a country where people take pride in flaunting brute aggression, and almost every other household has experienced some form of domestic violence. Here, the average man has little to no regard for the law or law-enforcement agencies, and vice versa. So, violence and abuse against both animals and humans are unrestrained and rampant. Ironically, but not surprisingly, according to the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) ‘Domestic Violence Policy Brief 2023’, “there are limited statistics available on domestic violence in Pakistan”. However, the available figures are “likely much higher due to under-reporting”. It is interesting that the brief mentions that domestic violence has a significant impact on children in Pakistan and around the world. It explains that “children who grow up in affected households are more likely to become perpetrators of violence themselves in the future”. This is precisely what the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child meant when it specified that minors must be kept away from violence against animals. The Franz Weber Foundation (FFW), which fights against animal abuse, highlighted, “the committee’s call is an important wake-up call to all countries, especially those with specific practices of animal abuse normalised as a cultural, social or traditional heritage”. It would not be wrong to say that Pakistan falls in this category. A very recent example is of Pakistani children in Karachi torturing a donkey and a dog with banned vuvuzelas. Clearly, an adult filmed both instances and did not bother to intervene, and that speaks for itself. FBI agent Robert K. Ressler, who developed profiles of serial killers, affirmed that “murderers... very often start out by killing and torturing animals as kids”. This connection between animal abuse and violence against humans is referred to as “The Link”. There is also overwhelming global evidence that abusive individuals and partners often have a strong history of animal abuse and often harm family pets to terrorise their family members. Anyone with a functional brain would understand “The Link” and why it is critically essential for animal abuse to be taken seriously — not only for the sake of animals but also for the safety of observers and children who are also at risk of being abused and can, in turn, potentially become abusers of humans and animals themselves. But when will Pakistanis join the dots? There is no shortage of local news reports of Pakistanis gleefully participating in, observing, cheering on, and recording instances of unprovoked animal abuse both in private and in public. It really begs the question of why live animal abuse continues to be an “entertainment” in Pakistan and why no research has been performed on “The Link” here. Recognising animal cruelty as a serious and violent offence is still a distant dream for Pakistan, and now that the UN has made “The Link” obvious and important, at least for children, it is hoped that it will open the eyes of our slumbering countrymen (and women) and will push lawmakers to incorporate the announcement into child protection laws so that the younger generations will have lesser animal abuse statistics to boast of.

2024-05-04T00:00:00Z,Spain scraps national bullfighting prize,Spain scraps national bullfighting prize - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831356,"MADRID: Spain’s left leaning incumbent government stated on Friday it plans on scrapping a national prize for bullfighting. The move has infuriated aficionados of the controversial spectacle but was welcomed with open arms by animal rights groups. “A growing majority” of Spaniards are deeply concerned about animal welfare, so “we did not believe it is appropriate to maintain an award that rewards a form of animal abuse” stated the Minsister for Culture, Ernest Urtasun. Urtasun is associated with the hard-left political party ‘Sumar’, who are currently Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s junior coalition partners. “I think they understand even less that these forms of animal torture are rewarded with medals that come with monetary prizes using public money” he added, during an interview with a private television channel, La Sexta. The annual prize for bullfighting came to be in 2011, under a previous left-leaning government. The prize was first awarded in 2013 and grants 30,000 euros ($32,000) to winners. Top matadors such as Enrique Ponce and Julian Lopez, known as “El Juli”, have secured the prize in the past. Bullfighting retains an ardent following in certain circles of Spanish civic life and leading matadors are often treated as celebrities. However, the practice’s mass appeal has slowly begun to fade, with polls showing a rising level of disinterest across the country, especially among the younger lot.

The footage resulted in calls for immediate action to protect stray animals from such vile and inhumane behaviour. The graphic video was shared by the Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation (ACF) with a caption detailing the incident: “In Liaquatabad, Karachi, this group of boys threw the dog off a terrace because they were angry that homeless dogs were coming near the apartment to look for food”. The Sharifabad police have arrested a janitor named Qasim. A case has been registered under Section 5 and Section 428 of the Pakistan penal code at the Sharifabad police station. “There are six to seven more dogs that they have trapped to torture,” the animal shelter claimed. “The more we do this work, the more we realise that it is less about educating people and more about opening our eyes to understand that human beings are pure evil. Just look at the state of the world, do you think human beings are good?” the caption questioned. This distressing incident, along with other cases of animal abuse and dog culling in the country, has prompted many people to voice their outrage and demand justice for the innocent and voiceless. View this post on Instagram Artist Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Jr took to Instagram to passionately denounce the act. In a video, he said, “Yesterday in Liaquatabad, the residents of a building threw a dog from that 7 to 8 floor building. That dog has died. I have sent my men to inquire why these people did what they did. I would also request all the followers of Shaheed Bhutto in that area to ask these people why they did that to an innocent animal. The screams of the innocent reach God.” He said that these acts of cruelty are what really spoil the image of a country. “Remember that you are ruining the image of Pakistan,” he said. “When you kill an innocent animal, you have ruined our country’s reputation. You have made us monsters in the eyes of the rest of the world and I hope you pay for it.” Actor Nadia Afgan expressed her horror and grief over another incident through an emotional Instagram video. Afgan, who has been an outspoken advocate for animal rights, struggled to find words to describe her feelings: “ACF shelter sent me a video, and I haven’t been able to sleep for two nights.” View this post on Instagram She went on to describe the graphic and horrifying details of the video, which showed a mob torturing stray dogs to death. One man in the video even threatened similar violence against anyone showing kindness to stray dogs. Afgan questioned the moral compass of those involved, repeatedly asking, “Aren’t you people afraid of God?” “You wonder why bad things happen to you when you can’t even follow the teachings of our religion and be kind to a creature who has never done you any harm! I am not one to curse, but I pray that something even worse happens to you than what you have done to these dogs. You will all face a trial for this one way or the other. You should be ashamed of yourselves.” Afgan also called on the government, police force, and animal rights activists to take decisive action against anyone displaying cruelty to animals. She urged her followers to educate themselves and their children to prevent such horrific acts from being perpetuated by future generations. In a heartfelt caption accompanying her video, Afgan lamented the moral decline in Pakistani society: “We as a nation have no respect for anyone or any living being. This needs to stop. We have to make this country and this world a better place. Stop dog culling. The government needs to step in and put an end to the ruthless killing of dogs everywhere.” The incident has struck a nerve across the nation, with many calling for stricter laws and harsher penalties for animal abusers. Several are horrified by the incident and many more have lost faith in humanity. “I don’t want to talk about human rights anymore,” one user wrote in an Instagram story reshared by the ACF. “We are living in a society where people throw animals from the top of buildings,” they said, condemning the act and talking about how we’ve failed as a nation. More users spoke about how the incident was sickening and shameful, yet it wasn’t getting the attention it deserved. “You think these psychopaths won’t come for your children? For you? Since you all are so concerned with yourselves. Hold the people who are inciting and carrying out such nauseating levels of violence against animals accountable,” one user whose story was shared by the ACF demanded. Others said it is high time society learns about animal rights Stray animals are rounded up and killed en masse on a routine basis in Karachi to curb their population. Municipal laws allow authorities to either poison or shoot stray dogs with impunity — a practice that has been widely condemned as being cruel and inhumane. In May last year, a video of a dog being killed by hanging in Karachi was widely shared on social media. The video showed a man hanging a dog from a rack with the help of a rope. The man, the watchman of a market, was later detained. The local SHO said that he “may have employed the wrong means of killing the dog — hanging him, instead of poisoning or shooting, a usual practice in the city to kill dogs in a bid to protect children against dog bites.” Unfortunately, moments of outrage online do little to curb such incidents. It is time local governments invest more in neutering stray dogs if population control is such a problem. In December last year, the Karachi local government was asked to work with ACF to launch a public awareness campaign to prevent cruelty towards animals. Former caretaker chief minister Justice (retd) Maqbool Baqar directed the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to provide six vans to ACF to help rescue and neuter stray dogs. The ACF has since said that it never received any vans. However, the ACF is just one of the very few functional animal shelters in the city and does not have the capacity to shelter all stray animals in the metropolis. Our government needs to create more animal shelters or help existing ones expand if people are not interested in adopting or even feeding stray dogs. Education isn’t the only thing needed to stop these kinds of cruel incidents from happening — we need to foster a sense of empathy in our people, something that is sorely lacking if they think the

2024-06-16T00:00:00Z,Six suspects remanded in police custody for allegedly mutilating camel in Sanghar,Six suspects remanded in police custody for allegedly mutilating camel in Sanghar - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1840277/six-suspects-remanded-in-police-custody-for-allegedly-mutilating-camel-in-sanghar,"A magistrate in Shahdadpur on Sunday remanded six suspects into police custody in connection with the mutilation of a camel that saw the animal’s right leg chopped off in Mund Jamrao village in Sanghar district days ago. The incident took place on Friday when a landlord allegedly chopped off the camel’s leg as punishment for foraging into his field for fodder. Sanghar police took notice of the incident, news of which was widely circulated on social media, and contacted the owner of the brutalised camel, Soomar Behan, who was a poor peasant. Police officials said the peasant had refused to identify the culprit and press charges against him, hence police lodged an FIR on behalf of the state against six unknown persons under sections 429 (Mischief by killing or maiming cattle) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). When police tried to arrest the six suspects on Saturday, they allegedly resisted and attacked them, according to another FIR filed by police. The six suspects were identified as Rustam Shar, Abid Shar, Jaffar Jatt, Abdul Shakoor Shar, Gul Baig Lashari and Darya Khan Shar, and were arrested from Rantoo Bridge near Sanghar. The second FIR was filed under sections 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 147 (Punishment for rioting), 148 (Rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) of the PPC. According to Sub-Inspector Atta Hussain Jutt, the suspects were presented before duty magistrate Asif Sial on Sunday, where police requested the suspects be remanded for 14 days for further investigation, positing that they needed to find the weapon used in the incident. The magistrate, however, remanded the suspects to police custody for only four days. PPP minister Shazia Marri and former PPP senator Quratulain Marri took stern notice of the incident, with Shazia taking to X to announce that suspects had been arrested and the injured camel had been transported to the Comprehensive Disaster Response Services (CDRS) animal shelter in Karachi. In a separate statement, Shazia and Quratulain Marri said that veterinary doctors referred them to CDRS, adding that rescuing the camel was a “joint effort”. “I was extremely saddened to hear the news of this tragic incident [and I] took immediate steps, Shazia said. “This kind of barbaric treatment against a speechless being is reprehensible,” she added, stating that those responsible would be punished severely. We called a team of doctors and [were] immediately referred to CDRS, who took the camel to safety and started care,“ said Quratulain. “If they had not taken care of it, the camel might not be with us.” “From carrying her through the fields to treating her wound under a flashlight, everyone who helped the camel is a hero,” she added. CDRS Benji Director Sarah Jahangir told Dawn.com that the camel — affectionately named Cammie by shelter staff — is stable but infection is an ever present threat. “She’s stable but her leg is infected,” she said. “Treatment involves applying fresh dressings, antibiotics and IV fluids […] we’re trying to keep infection at bay”. View this post on Instagram She added that the team’s focus is on pain management, preventing further infection and making sure the animal stands up and moves around. “The camel is 8 months old, and one of our concerns is that we need to make sure she stands up and moves around otherwise she will develop bloat in her stomach.” Sarah confirmed that the PPP senior members arranged the wounded animal’s transport to the shelter. “Shazia and Anny (Quratulain) Marri had the camel loaded into a truck and brought to Karachi with a police protocol,” she said, adding that the animal arrived at 2am in excruciating agony. She added that CDRS has been exploring options for prosthetic legs for the camel and is due to meet experts from both Karachi and Dubai.",2025-11-15,a magistrate in shahdadpur on sunday remanded six suspects into police custody in connection with the mutilation of a camel that saw the animal s right leg chopped off in mund jamrao village in sanghar district days ago the incident took place on friday when a landlord allegedly chopped off the camel s leg as punishment for foraging into his field for fodder sanghar police took notice of the incident news of which was widely circulated on social media and contacted the owner of the brutalised camel soomar behan who was a poor peasant police officials said the peasant had refused to identify the culprit and press charges against him hence police lodged an fir on behalf of the state against six unknown persons under sections mischief by killing or maiming cattle and common intention of the pakistan penal code ppc when police tried to arrest the six suspects on saturday they allegedly resisted and attacked them according to another fir filed by police the six suspects were identified as rustam shar abid shar jaffar jatt abdul shakoor shar gul baig lashari and darya khan shar and were arrested from rantoo bridge near sanghar the second fir was filed under sections assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty punishment for rioting rioting armed with deadly weapon and every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object of the ppc according to sub inspector atta hussain jutt the suspects were presented before duty magistrate asif sial on sunday where police requested the suspects be remanded for days for further investigation positing that they needed to find the weapon used in the incident the magistrate however remanded the suspects to police custody for only four days ppp minister shazia marri and former ppp senator quratulain marri took stern notice of the incident with shazia taking to x to announce that suspects had been arrested and the injured camel had been transported to the comprehensive disaster response services cdrs animal shelter in karachi in a separate statement shazia and quratulain marri said that veterinary doctors referred them to cdrs adding that rescuing the camel was a joint effort i was extremely saddened to hear the news of this tragic incident and i took immediate steps shazia said this kind of barbaric treatment against a speechless being is reprehensible she added stating that those responsible would be punished severely we called a team of doctors and were immediately referred to cdrs who took the camel to safety and started care said quratulain if they had not taken care of it the camel might not be with us from carrying her through the fields to treating her wound under a flashlight everyone who helped the camel is a hero she added cdrs benji director sarah jahangir told dawn com that the camel affectionately named cammie by shelter staff is stable but infection is an ever present threat she s stable but her leg is infected she said treatment involves applying fresh dressings antibiotics and iv fluids we re trying to keep infection at bay view this post on instagram she added that the team s focus is on pain management preventing further infection and making sure the animal stands up and moves around the camel is months old and one of our concerns is that we need to make sure she stands up and moves around otherwise she will develop bloat in her stomach sarah confirmed that the ppp senior members arranged the wounded animal s transport to the shelter shazia and anny quratulain marri had the camel loaded into a truck and brought to karachi with a police protocol she said adding that the animal arrived at am in excruciating agony she added that cdrs has been exploring options for prosthetic legs for the camel and is due to meet experts from both karachi and dubai
2024-06-26T00:00:00Z,Cruelty to animals,Cruelty to animals - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1842063/cruelty-to-animals,"IT has been about two weeks since a heartbreaking incident of camel mutilation came to light in Pakistan. In that case, it was alleged that a landowner, enraged by a camel that had been foraging in his field, cut off the poor animal’s leg. The female camel was only eight months old. The camel’s poor owner named the landlord as the culprit, but said that the police were trying to protect him. Earlier, the police had arrested six suspects but said they could not find proof of the landlord’s involvement in this act of barbarity. The case only gained prominence when a video of the maimed camel went viral on social media. The Sindh government is said to be working with an NGO to provide an artificial limb to the injured camel. It is unfortunate that this is only one of several instances pertaining to animal abuse in Pakistan. In fact, this form of bestiality is rampant in the country. Just a little before the camel incident, an extremely disturbing video emerged of a dog being thrown from a balcony of a high-rise building, while days after it, news emerged about a man cutting off a donkey’s ears. Taken together with the shabby treatment meted out to animals at Pakistan’s zoos (the case of the elephant Noor Jehan in Karachi immediately comes to mind), these incidents expose the depth of inhumanity that now exists in society. Being a good human being requires speaking up when helpless and voiceless animals are being abused. Research shows that a proclivity for animal abuse is a primary indication that the perpetrator is a psychopath and likely to act similarly towards human beings. If this is true, Pakistan has no dearth of potential criminals whose complete lack of empathy for the suffering of other living beings is there for all to see. There is no one in this country who has not been a witness to animal cruelty; but most of us continue to watch and allow it to happen. Dogs, known to be particularly intelligent companions for human beings, are treated abhorrently in Pakistan. While there may be notions about impurities regarding canines, that does not mean that those who subscribe to this view physically harm them. Harming living things is a sign of a sick and depraved society. All living things are deserving of respect and a peaceful existence, and the idea that an animal is deserving of ill-treatment speaks volumes of the cruelty that abounds in the human race. It is sickening to see helpless and voiceless creatures such as camels, dogs, cats and donkeys being mistreated — and everyone ignoring their suffering. Human beings may be the most sentient creatures on the planet, but this does not mean that animals are not sensitive and do not experience emotions. It is not a question of who is more intelligent — human or animals — it’s just that there are different kinds of intelligence for man and beast. Studies have revealed self-awareness and emotions in the animal kingdom often through vocalisations and gestures. Experiments on fish have shown that they express feeling pain through rocking and hyperventilating. Marc Bekoff, the author of The Emotional Lives of Animals, presents the case of prairie dogs, which are a kind of large rodent, like a mongoose. One day while cycling in Colorado, Bekoff saw a telling interaction. A large black-tailed prairie dog was trying to retrieve the carcass of her young one. The baby had just been killed on the road, likely owing to an accident. Bekoff saw the mother try five or six times to drag the carcass off the road, perhaps so that it would not be further crushed by cars. The example is telling because one may not expect rodents to feel sad or grieve for their young. However, there are many such examples of even smaller animals acting in ways that do not have a simple explanation in terms of the desire to safeguard one’s own. If anything, the mother was endangering her own life to retrieve the body that no longer had any survival value to her. Perhaps a better-known example is of elephants, known to mourn their dead and to bury them. Even tiny sea creatures have their own kind of emotional interplay. The Curious World of Sea Horses, published last year, details how sea horse couples engage in ritual dances to ensure that their reproductive cycles are synced. Other research has provided proof that elephants indeed have an incredible memory, showing that these social beasts can remember their relatives for up to 12 years just through their sense of smell. All this is to press home the point that animals feel the cruelties that are inflicted upon them. They are also capable of experiencing fun and joy, as anyone with pets would know. There are reams that have been written and that will be written on the glories of the natural world. It is useful to remember that there are many countries that do an excellent job of taking care of animals through stringent laws against any form of animal cruelty and through welfare projects. Take the case of Turkey, where there are no ‘stray’ animals as such, as the government takes care of all the cats and dogs on the streets and makes sure that they are well fed and not tortured or harassed, and that they have been vaccinated. In Pakistan, too, awareness of animal rights is on the rise, with NGOs doing good work for animal rescue and rehabilitation. However, cruelty towards animals is still a behavioural trait. It is a sign of a society where nothing and no one is spared abuse. Being a good human being requires speaking up when helpless and voiceless animals are being abused. The least one can do is to record incidents of animal cruelty and proliferate them on social media so that all criminal abusers are exposed.

2024-07-08T00:00:00Z,The tale of an amputated camel and a broken society,The tale of an amputated camel and a broken society - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1842305,"On June 14, a local landlord in Sindh’s Sanghar district allegedly chopped off a camel’s leg as punishment for daring to venture into his field for fodder in the Mund Jamrao village. The eight-month old female camel, Cammie, as she is now being called, was eventually moved to a shelter but her agonising cries echoed on social media for the next several days if not weeks. View this post on Instagram In Pakistan, such acts of barbarity aren’t all that new. Last week, videos of stray dogs caged at a medical university in Punjab — purportedly used for ‘experiments’ — started doing the rounds. Before that, news had come forth of a donkey being brutally beaten up in Hyderabad. Unable to sustain the brutal injuries, Dobby the donkey passed away. Just a look at the streets is enough to prove this; battered and brutally injured stray animals — from donkeys to cats and dogs — aren’t a rare sight in Karachi. Having closely witnessed this abuse, there are several questions that come to mind, the most prominent of them being: why would someone do something so horrific to a being that can’t fight back or even voice their pain? According to research by the Animal & Society Institute, animal cruelty perpetrators have higher chances of involvement in crimes against humans, as well as other problematic behaviours. “Researchers have suggested that involvement in animal cruelty behaviours, either as an observer or participant, may be associated with the development of attitudes that reflect a general insensitivity toward the well-being of others,” the study highlighted. View this post on Instagram Psychotherapist Farwa Naqvi concurred with these findings. “Any kind of abuse, be it with animals or humans, is a crime of power,” she told Dawn.com. “The abuser comes from a place of victimhood and wants to feel powerful.” She explained that people abuse animals when they don’t regard them as equal and consider their lives inferior to that of humans. “Research shows that serial killers/offenders always begin with animals … the less powerful … then like a hit it keeps increasing with time.” And the seed of this apathy is sown at the stage of adolescence. Referring to the recent incident of a stray dog being thrown off the roof in Karachi, the psychotherapist highlighted that many children were present at the site. “Just the way you teach kids languages, you also teach them mannerisms. So when they see their elders indulging in such crimes, they are likely to do the same because in their minds, this is the right thing to do. “This way, we are killing empathy and emotional intelligence in our children; if they don’t feel empathy for animals, how would they feel empathy for their family members and others around them?” she emphasised. Dr Quratul Ain Rizvi, a professor at Karachi University’s Criminology Department, pointed out that often, animal abuse becomes a childhood pattern and matures into criminal tendencies. “These children grow up with the mindset that if hitting animals is okay, so is doing the same with humans.” The abuse even becomes an avenue for channelling anger and aggression. “Usually, these behaviours are taken from a familiar place — the child must have seen someone doing it in their surroundings, probably their parents or elders, and thought it was okay,” she explained. This then becomes a vicious cycle with no end in sight. Both Naqvi and Rizvi agreed that irrespective of age, there are two factors that encourage abuse: entitlement and impunity. Animal abuse, the experts said, is repetitive because the perpetrators know they will get away with anything. “They do not consider what they are doing to be a crime because there is no punishment for it,” Naqvi highlighted, adding that the onus was on the government to penalise animal abuse. Unfortunately, Pakistan has almost no animal welfare policy or service in place. The most prominent law for animal protection, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1890) — which dates back to the colonial era — is limited in scope and lacks understanding of animal welfare in today’s context. For instance, the maximum fine for animal cruelty in the law has remained at Rs50, for first-time offenders, since it was introduced in 1890. The government had amended the law in 2018, increasing the fines to Rs10,000. However, that is only restricted to Islamabad and does not extend to the rest of the country because after the 18th Amendment, provinces were required to enact their own laws, which is yet to be done. Syed Naeem Abbas, advocacy manager at animal welfare organisation, Brooke Pakistan, pointed out that although the existing law criminalises beating and cruelty, it does not talk about an animal’s well-being. “We need to understand that today’s issues are different and should either update outdated laws or introduce new ones,” he stressed. Abbas told Dawn.com that his organisation and the Sindh government had drafted a bill on animal welfare. The bill’s draft was prepared in 2021 and has been travelling within departments to date. It was recently sent to the law department by the livestock department for approval following which it will be presented in the provincial assembly. The new law, when and if enacted, would entail legal action against experimentation on animals, penalise overloading, overworking and use of sub-standard medicines, and criminalise cruel practices and neglect. “It will empower the livestock department to appoint inspectors who would be given the authority to punish and arrest those who indulge in animal abuse,” Abbas said. The law would also increase punishment — jail time and fines — for offenders. But again, the question of when the bill would be turned into law hangs in the air. “We have done our part, the rest is now the government’s job … but we can clearly see that animals are not their priority,” Abbas lamented. Speaking to Dawn.com, Sindh Livestock Department Director General Nazir Kalhoro said there were 1,157 veterinary hospitals across the province but the vast majority of them were not overseen by a proper authority, and neither was a budget allocated for them. “We are only given funds sufficient for the provision of medicines, free vaccination and first aid,” he stated. At the Richmond Crawford Veterinary Hospital in Karachi, one of the handful of veterinary hospitals run by the provincial livestock department, the conditions are appalling to say the least. Before even entering the building, it is the shrill cries of animals that welcome you. The old and dilapidated walls of the hospital have been hidden with shiny paint. Inside, lifeless animals lie on stretchers as vets tower over them. The backyard of the Richmond Crawford Veterinary Hospital in Karachi. — photo by author The hospital comprises a total of three rooms and a hall. Unsurprisingly, the largest room has been allocated to the head of the facility while the doctors get small desks set up in the hall. Ironically, that is also where small animals such as dogs and cats are treated. Adjacent to the hall is an operation theatre. The stench inside is overpowering and it is hard to ignore the forgotten blood stains on the operating table. The rust-laden surgical equipment narrates yet another tale. But the worst is yet to come. The backdoor of the hospital leads to a backyard where sheep, donkeys, goats and cows are treated. These animals are attended to on a makeshift wooden table under a tree. Some even lie on the hard ground, writhing in pain, waiting for someone to tend to them. According to Dr Chander Kumar, the head of the facility, the hospital operates from 9am to 8pm with doctors on duty round the clock and provides free-of-cost medicines and treatment. “We take all cases, from accidental injuries to spay and neuter,” he said. The facility does not have an ambulance or a rescue service and solely relies on those citizens who care about animals a tad bit more than others. It also lacks facilities for the admission of injured and critical animals. However, work on upgrading indoor treatment facilities at the Richmond Crawford Veterinary Hospital is under way, claimed Dr Safdar Ali, deputy director of Animal Husbandry and Livestock, Karachi. “Hopefully, our plans will materialise within the next six months.” He told Dawn.com that the department was doing its best given the budgetary and other limitations, particularly the shortage of vets. “As per international standards, there should be one vet for 10,000 animals. But here, there is one doctor for 80,000 animals,” Dr Safdar lamented. He hopes that this will change though. Following outrage over the camel incident, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah issued orders for the posting of good practising veterinary doctors and technicians along with the provision of facilities such as X-ray machines, ultrasound and others. Meanwhile, the government’s inefficiencies and inadequacies are rapidly filling up privately run animal shelters, forcing them to make the difficult choice of who can be rescued and who cannot. Activists point out that not just street animals, even pets have it tough, often sharing the same fate at the hands of humans. According to Naqvi, the reason behind this is that for most people keeping pets has become more of a status symbol and has less to do with genuine affection. Dr Meena Memon, a vet, recalled the day when a labrador was brought to her clinic. “The Edhi Foundation’s rescue team had brought him over … they said the poor animal was tied to an electricity pole for days after his owners abandoned him,” she told Dawn.com. The dog had lost consciousness after being left under the heat for days without food and water. Despite several efforts, he didn’t make it. This is one such case. The social media feeds of shelters, such as the Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation and CDRS Benji, are filled with heartbreaking stories of beaten and bruised animals. View this post on Instagram Sarah Jehangir, who runs CDRS Benji — the shelter where Cammie is under treatment — told Dawn.com that the cases of animal abuse are rampant and way more than what was probably reported or seen on social media. “We just can’t reach them.” Running a shelter and rescue service is not an easy job. It requires not just money but also food, medical attention and safe spaces. “We get hundreds of cases but there’s a lack of donations … people are willing to report these cases but not willing to get involved,” Sarah said. It is therefore impossible for rescue services to take in all animals. While human beings may be the most sentient creatures on this planet, animals too are sensitive and experience emotions, just as we do. Recent studies have shown that fish might experience anxiety, camels can feel threatened, and dogs can get depressed. “All forms of life have a significance,” said Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar. “If one swifts through history, you will find the innumerable sacrifices that animals have rendered for us … and their contribution to the planet we live on today is unimaginable.” There is a vast amount of scientific literature that backs Mahar’s statement. It shows that animals have a deep and positive impact on human life, and serve to be the best of companions. “But the widespread disinformation in society today makes us blind to all of these facts,” the conservator decried. He stressed that it was important to combat this through awareness, particularly among children. “We need to update our curriculum by introducing religious and scientific lessons that debunk these theories,” he said, adding that softness with animals was an integral teaching of Islam as well. “We see so much hatred for dogs in our society … If they were so bad, why would God create them in the first place?” In his classic novel, ‘The Unbearable Lightness of Being’, Milan Kundera writes: “True human goodness, in all its purity and freedom, can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power. “Mankind’s true moral test, its fundamental test (which lies deeply buried from view), consists of its attitude toward those who are at its mercy: animals. And in this respect, mankind has suffered a fundamental debacle, a debacle so fundamental that all others stem from it.” Header image created with generative AI",2025-11-15,on june a local landlord in

is also where small animals such as dogs and cats are treated adjacent to the hall is an operation theatre the stench inside is overpowering and it is hard to ignore the forgotten blood stains on the operating table the rust laden surgical equipment narrates yet another tale but the worst is yet to come the backdoor of the hospital leads to a backyard where sheep donkeys goats and cows are treated these animals are attended to on a makeshift wooden table under a tree some even lie on the hard ground writhing in pain waiting for someone to tend to them according to dr chander kumar the head of the facility the hospital operates from am to pm with doctors on duty round the clock and provides free of cost medicines and treatment we take all cases from accidental injuries to spay and neuter he said the facility does not have an ambulance or a rescue service and solely relies on those citizens who care about animals a tad bit more than others it also lacks facilities for the admission of injured and critical animals however work on upgrading indoor treatment facilities at the richmond crawford veterinary hospital is under way claimed dr safdar ali deputy director of animal husbandry and livestock karachi hopefully our plans will materialise within the next six months he told dawn com that the department was doing its best given the budgetary and other limitations particularly the shortage of vets as per international standards there should be one vet for animals but here there is one doctor for animals dr safdar lamented he hopes that this will change though following outrage over the camel incident sindh chief minister murad ali shah issued orders for the posting of good practising veterinary doctors and technicians along with the provision of facilities such as x ray machines ultrasound and others meanwhile the government s inefficiencies and inadequacies are rapidly filling up privately run animal shelters forcing them to make the difficult choice of who can be rescued and who cannot activists point out that not just street animals even pets have it tough often sharing the same fate at the hands of humans according to naqvi the reason behind this is that for most people keeping pets has become more of a status symbol and has less to do with genuine affection dr meena memon a vet recalled the day when a labrador was brought to her clinic the edhi foundation s rescue team had brought him over they said the poor animal was tied to an electricity pole for days after his owners abandoned him she told dawn com the dog had lost consciousness after being left under the heat for days without food and water despite several efforts he didn t make it this is one such case the social media feeds of shelters such as the ayesha chundrigar foundation and cdrs benji are filled with heartbreaking stories of beaten and bruised animals view this post on instagram sarah jehangir who runs cdrs benji the shelter where cammie is under treatment told dawn com that the cases of animal abuse are rampant and way more than what was probably reported or seen on social media we just can t reach them running a shelter and rescue service is not an easy job it requires not just money but also food medical attention and safe spaces we get hundreds of cases but there s a lack of donations people are willing to report these cases but not willing to get involved sarah said it is therefore impossible for rescue services to take in all animals while human beings may be the most sentient creatures on this planet animals too are sensitive and experience emotions just as we do recent studies have shown that fish might experience anxiety camels can feel threatened and dogs can get depressed all forms of life have a significance said sindh wildlife conservator javed ahmed mahar if one swifts through history you will find the innumerable sacrifices that animals have rendered for us and their contribution to the planet we live on today is unimaginable there is a vast amount of scientific literature that backs mahar s statement it shows that animals have a deep and positive impact on human life and serve to be the best of companions but the widespread disinformation in society today makes us blind to all of these facts the conservator decried he stressed that it was important to combat this through awareness particularly among children we need to update our curriculum by introducing religious and scientific lessons that debunk these theories he said adding that softness with animals was an integral teaching of islam as well we see so much hatred for dogs in our society if they were so bad why would god create them in the first place in his classic novel the unbearable lightness of being milan kundera writes true human goodness in all its purity and freedom can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power mankind s true moral test its fundamental test which lies deeply buried from view consists of its attitude toward those who are at its mercy animals and in this respect mankind has suffered a fundamental debacle a debacle so fundamental that all others stem from it header image created with
